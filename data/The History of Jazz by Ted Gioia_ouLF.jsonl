{"text": "But the notoriety of these achievements paled beside the fierce debates ignited by the New York debut of the Ornette Coleman Quartet on the heels of the release of these two records.The band opened at the Five Spot on November 17, 1959, with interest running so high that the club took the rare step of offering a preview for the press and select members of the local jazz establishment.Some listeners walked out, others sat transfixed, and though there was no consensus among the audience, almost every opinion was adamant."}

{"text": "For years, he had avoided hiring harmony instrument players, such as pianists or guitarists, for his band.But in the early 1970s, Coleman began an association with guitarist James Blood Ulmer.Ulmer brought a radically different texture to Coleman's ensemble, mixing free jazz with elements of funk, rock, and experimental electronic music."}
{"text": "In place of Coleman's human cry on the saxophone, one finds Taylor's fusillade of notes, unforgiving and unapologetic.Born in Long Island City, New York, in 1929, Taylor was raised in the predominantly white neighborhood of Corona.'Music to me was a way of holding on to Negro culture, because there wasn't very much of it around,' Taylor has recalled . At age five he began studying the piano."}
{"text": "Lessons were supplemented by instruction from his piano teacher's husband, a tympanist who had played under Toscanini-an especially fitting early association given the extremely percussive nature of Taylor's mature style.In 1952, Taylor entered the New England Conservatory of Music, where he expanded his knowledge of contemporary classical music but grew disenchanted with the academy's indifference to the black musical experience.This same period found Taylor deepening his knowledge of the jazz idiom."}

{"text": "A stint at the Five Spot in New York spurred further controversy and attracted an enthusiastic following among artists and bohemians.In 1960 and 1961, Taylor had the opportunity to record for the short-lived Candid label.Taylor still plays the occasional standard such as 'Lazy Afternoon' and 'This Nearly Was Mine'-performances that border on reconstructive surgery-and engages in stock devices such as trading four-bar phrases with the drummer on 'Air.'"}
{"text": "But these last lingering affectations of traditional jazz playing do little to blunt the porcupine quills of this prickly music.A second Candid session from 1961, ostensibly under the leadership of bassist Neidlinger, found Taylor refining these same techniques.'Cell Walk for Celeste,' from this date, underscores the formalist elements often hidden beneath the apparent free-form flow of the pianist's work."}
{"text": "This eighty-eight-bar theme captures a number of distinct moods, ranging from brooding melancholy to sardonic exultation.The piece represented Taylor's most successful endeavor to date in blending contemporary classical elements into a distinctly African American style-'almost as though riding in on the morning train from Danbury, Charles Ives got off at 125th Street instead of Grand Central Terminal,' is how Neidlinger later described the performance . Downbeat awarded Taylor its prestigious New Star award in 1962, but this did little to improve his commercial prospects.'Gigs for me have been mostly, like a concert a year, filled in with one or two short nightclub or coffeehouse gigs,' Taylor told author A."}
{"text": "Spellman around this time . To support himself, Taylor took jobs as a dishwasher and short-order cook.But, in 1966, Taylor burst forth with a number of important projects, including two milestone dates for the Blue Note label and a live recording made in France.Unit Structures, recorded for Blue Note in May, stands as a landmark performance for Taylor, a full flowering of the promise shown on 'Air' and 'Cell Walk for Celeste.'"}
{"text": "The flow of time in Taylor's music was, by this time, completely free of conventional jazz metrics.Taylor's collaborations with drummer Sunny Murray during the early 1960s had assisted in this process, one furthered by the pianist's later work with Andrew Cyrille.Despite the absence of typical swing and bop phrasing, these pieces maintain, for most of their duration, a powerful rhythmic dynamism."}
{"text": "The horns crisscross arrhythmically on top of these layers of sound, entering into haranguing dialogues with the rhythm section and each other.In the final analysis, Unit Structures ranks with Coleman's Free Jazz, Ayler's Spiritual Unity, and Coltrane's Ascension as defining statements of the free jazz movement as it matured in the early 1960s.But of these four efforts, Taylor's is the most controlled and multidimensional."}
{"text": "Yet it equally avoids empty emoting and unrelenting sturm-und-drang exhortation.Taylor's efforts during the 1960s solidified his reputation as the most uncompromising exponent of the jazz avant-garde.With the jazz revival of the early 1970s, Taylor emerged as a respected elder statesman of the music-a surprising twist for this erstwhile revolutionary."}

{"text": "Only a short time before, Coltrane had been the leading light of mainstream tenor playing.Now in a series of recordings-above all with his orgiastic 1965 release Ascension-he emerged as one of the most radical of the new school.This formidable forty-minute performance found Coltrane and his rhythm section supplemented by a half-dozen horn players in a wild free-for-all-a superheated encounter that, for many listeners, served as the fitting, logical, and anarchistic end point of this quest for freedom."}

{"text": "Free jazz snubbed its nose at the established order, and in an era in which the 'establishment' was increasingly under assault, this alone was a powerful rallying point.As such, the freedom movement shared in the same zeitgeist that gave birth to acid rock, campus demonstrations, and the 1960s counterculture.Both the advocates and detractors of the avant-garde sensed this, to greater and lesser degrees, and though their debates often seemed to focus on the music, a deeper strain of discourse, politicized and ideologically charged, almost always underscored these interchanges."}
{"text": "One could probably determine this merely by looking at the album covers, which announced 'the shape of jazz to come' or the 'change of the century'-claims no jazz player in any other style would dare to make.Even after it became clear that atonality was not the end point of jazz, merely a stopping point in a constantly fluctuating scene, this sharply ideological component in free jazz, and even more in discussions about it, has persisted, almost as if the ways critics conceptualize jazz got frozen sometime around the late 1950s and early 1960s.With the passing years, free jazz has become just another style-but the very ethos of the music hardly allows its fans to settle for anything less than a preeminent position as the Hegelian end point in the history of jazz."}
{"text": "These influences coexisted with more specific African American sources of inspiration, the residue of Ayler's personal history.In his native Cleveland, where he was born in 1936, Ayler performed saxophone duets in church with his father, who also introduced his son to swing and bebop jazz styles.During Ayler's teens, formal saxophone study was supplemented with work in jazz and rhythm-and-blues bands, as well as summer stints on the road with bluesman Little Walter."}
{"text": "In his early twenties, Ayler served three years in the military, playing in army ensembles, occasionally gracing the bandstands of European jazz clubs while stationed overseas, and listening to the free jazz sounds that were beginning to gain wider exposure.Ayler's first recordings, made during the early 1960s in Scandinavia, find him fighting against the constraints of the mainstream jazz tradition.By 1964, however, Ayler had developed his mature style, distinguished by an untempered excitability."}

{"text": "The younger sibling contributed uninhibited sound collages that complemented the saxophonist's fractious work.But he suffered from emotional instability and a drinking problem, which precipitated his firing from the band in 1968.In the latter half of the decade, Albert Ayler's music began to incorporate elements of a variety of vernacular styles."}
{"text": "These included rock, R & B, blues, gospel, vocal harmonies, even bagpipe music.His 1968 release New Grass must rank among the strangest jazz albums of the decade, with its attempt to mix freedom music and formulas from the commercial hits of the day.Here Ayler's untempered saxophony is backed by a hard-grooving rhythm section that includes funkmeister drummer Bernard Purdie, and is overwhelmed by a team of sassy if undistinguished Motown-ish singers."}
{"text": "Shortly before his death, the saxophonist showed signs of moving away from these crossover efforts.In November 1970, Ayler disappeared, and some three weeks later his body was found in the East River.He was thirty-four years old."}
{"text": "Others recalled signs of depression and mental instability that may have led Ayler to take his own life.Under other circumstances, the 1970s jazz revival would have surely given a major boost to Ayler's career, but his early death ensured that the accolades would be posthumous.Yet this saxophonist's period of peak creativity, for all its brevity, marked an important turning point in the history of jazz."}
{"text": "It is the most glorious of mongrels.Yet the concept of jazz as music of fusion took on particular relevance at the close of the 1960s.Jazz was on the brink of an especially pronounced period of absorption and expansion."}
{"text": "The types of fusion would vary widely, from the ethereal concert hall overtones of the ECM sound to the grooving disco beat of jazz-rock, but they shared an increasingly outward-looking focus.By the close of the 1970s, Buddy Bolden's legacy had truly conquered the world, but the New Orleans pioneer would hardly recognize his own progeny.It had become more than a style of music-it was a perspective that seemingly could encompass all musics."}
{"text": "It described highly commercial attempts to combine jazz with rock music.Miles Davis's recording of Bitches Brew at the close of the 1960s was a signal event in this regard.It legitimized a whole new area of exploration and experimentation for jazz musicians."}
{"text": "It legitimized a whole new area of exploration and experimentation for jazz musicians.This emerging rock-tinged sound substantially broadened the jazz audience, and one suspects that it played a decisive role in spurring the improving financial environment for all jazz styles during the 1970s.Fans who were introduced to jazz through fusion soon developed a taste for other styles of improvised music."}
{"text": "Sales figures for Bitches Brew provide an impressive measure of this change of affairs.A typical Davis mid-1960s release, despite the critical acclaim and lasting significance of this music, would sell fewer than 100,000 units at the time of release.But fans purchased 400,000 copies of Bitches Brew within its first year."}
{"text": "Davis was also now working with a wider range of musicians and sounds-for instance, the Bitches Brew sessions found Davis using twelve sidemen, ten of them in the rhythm section.Only Wayne Shorter was a holdover from the mid-1960s quintet.Some critics accused Davis of selling out."}
{"text": "Instead, they seemed just one more layer of sound, placed on top of the churning cauldron underneath.This record may be, as many claim, the father of 1970s fusion.Yet if so, one struggles to see its paternal resemblance to the overly arranged, ever-so-slick Grover Washington and Spyro Gyra releases it supposedly spawned."}
{"text": "Yet the rawness of this music, one suspects, accounted for much of its commercial success.It displayed a rebellious streak that was in tune with the counterculture attitudes of the late 1960s, giving Davis credibility with younger listeners who probably would have been 'turned off 'by a slicker format.The proof of this came with Davis's 1972 On the Corner."}

{"text": "In truth, many of Davis's former sidemen were passing him by in this regard.In 1975, Davis was relegated to touring as warm-up act for Herbie Hancock, whose jazz fusion/funk band Headhunters was reaching the same young black audience to which Davis merely aspired.The mixed reaction to his music was only one of many problems Davis now faced."}
{"text": "His drinking and drug problems further contributed to his deteriorating condition.Despite these aggravations, Davis continued an active schedule, undertaking concert performances in Japan in early 1975 that were recorded and eventually released as Agharta and Pangaea.But these were parting shots."}
{"text": "But this represented only part of the impact of former Davis sidemen on the new idiom.Hancock's 1973 Head Hunters release achieved massive sales and brought many younger listeners into the jazz camp with funk-oriented pieces such as 'Chameleon' and an updated version of 'Watermelon Man.'This album initiated a bifurcated career for Hancock, with his efforts now divided between mainstream jazz, often of the highest quality, and overtly commercial projects with little jazz substance."}
{"text": "George Benson, whose guitar work had graced Davis's Miles in the Sky release, made a more successful switch to vocal work.His mid-1970s cover version of Leon Russell's 'This Masquerade,' from the Breezin' album, initiated a series of pop hits for Benson- a success that threatened to obscure his talent as a soloist in a Wes Montgomery vein.Tony Williams's Lifetime band, which included organist Larry Young and guitarist John McLaughlin, was not as commercially successful as Hancock's or Benson's fusion efforts, but provided an even more sophisticated blending of rock energy with jazz instrumental prowess."}
{"text": "Many lesser-known Davis associates-Airto, Lonnie Liston Smith, Michael Henderson, and others-would never achieve the success of Head Hunters, Breezin' or Bitches Brew, but also sought, with varying degrees of success, to seize the momentum of the moment in attracting a crossover audience for their own bands.Chick Corea had already established himself as one of the most prominent jazz pianists of his generation when he founded his Return to Forever fusion group toward the close of 1971.Corea's early professional efforts found him working in both jazz ensembles and Latin bands."}
{"text": "His mainstream jazz approach, as it evolved, boasted a clean, sharply articulated piano sound, a mix of modal and impressionist harmonies, and a driving on-top-of-the-beat rhythmic feel.His 1967 sideman work on Stan Getz's Sweet Rain project already bespoke a mature piano stylist and composer, and his 1968 leader date Now He Sings, Now He Sobs drew much-deserved praise as one of the most creative piano trio projects of the period.Around this same time, Corea joined Davis's group and participated on Bitches Brew and several follow-up recordings, but, by the start of the 1970s, Corea had left the trumpeter to explore freer structures in his Circle band."}

{"text": "Like Metheny, the Brecker Brothers established themselves as fusion masters without first passing through a period of apprenticeship with Miles Davis.Yet these talented siblings-saxophonist Michael born in 1949 and trumpeter Randy born in 1945-were already journeyman players with deep jazz and rock roots by the time they released The Brecker Brothers on the Arista label in 1975.Michael had worked with Horace Silver and Billy Cobham, while Randy had played on the first Blood, Sweat and Tears album as well as with Art Blakey, Horace Silver, and Larry Coryell's The Eleventh House."}
{"text": "His rapidfire technique and mastery of a seemingly endless array of patterns and licks, married to a hard, cutting tone, made him the perfect saxophonist to survive in an age of guitarists, a flamboyant soloist who could rise to the occasion, whether he was working with an intimate jazz combo or on a festival stage surrounded by mountains of amplification and thousands of fans.While other fusion stars struggled to maintain their audience when the new traditionalists emerged on the scene in the 1980s and 1990s, Michael Brecker didn't miss a beat.His post-Brecker Brothers leader dates often took on a more mainstream guise, with fewer rock-funk elements, yet he was just as prepossessing flying over the changes of the old standards as grooving over a funky backbeat."}

{"text": "If the heroic age of fusion had ended, a new era of electronica had begun.Jazz artists continued to experiment with technological tools after the 1970s, but now they were just as likely to involve a laptop computer or piece of studio equipment as a synthesizer or electric guitar in the center of the stage.Sometime even low-tech devices managed to shake up the proceedings."}
{"text": "Sometime even low-tech devices managed to shake up the proceedings.Herbie Hancock's successful single 'Rockit' from his 1983 album Future Shock surprised many listeners at the time by featuring Grand Mixer DXT 'scratching' records-in essence, moving them back and forth by hand on a turntable to create various patterns of sound, usually highly rhythmic in nature.Even open-minded jazz fans may have had a hard time accepting a turntable as a musical instrument, yet resistance would gradually soften as scratches, loops, and samples, as well as programming tools of various sorts, found their place in the jazz world."}

{"text": "The band became the first Blue Note recording act to go platinum, selling a million copies in the United States-an ironic turn of events given how much of the creative energy on this CD resulted from appropriating the work of jazz legends who had never enjoyed much financial success.Around this same time, A Tribe Called Quest borrowed samples from a host of jazz sources-Cannonball Adderley, Art Blakey, Freddie Hubbard, Jack DeJohnette-for its pioneering 1991 release The Low End Theory.This disk went platinum and was selected by Time magazine in 2006 as one of the one hundred best albums of all time."}

{"text": "Input from the jazz side was usually secondhand, a matter of drawing on the archives as needed.However, by the mid-1990s, more ambitious efforts to combine original jazz and contemporary black popular music were underway, many of them involving respected jazz players, such as Max Roach, Branford Marsalis, Steve Coleman, Greg Osby, and Donald Byrd.These projects sold well in the United States and overseas, proving again that a jazz musician could play a role in this music as more than just a source for a sample."}
{"text": "Then again, almost every shift in the jazz sensibility during the last half of the twentieth century had involved this mercurial artist, and the trumpeter revealed, if anything, even greater restlessness in seeking after new sounds in the final days of his career.In the 1980s, a new generation of traditionalists were embracing acoustic instruments and the old Tin Pan Alley songs, but Davis was becoming more overtly commercial than ever before.He returned to the recording studio and concert hall, released cover versions of pop songs by Cyndi Lauper and Michael Jackson, and in general worked within tighter, more overtly arranged settings, which often reflected the influence of bassist Marcus Miller."}

{"text": "The band started out as a conventional jazz piano trio and only gradually came to embrace an electric sound, first as an easier way of taking their music on the road but eventually as a key part of their group identity.Yet the biggest change here versus the heroic age of 1970s fusion is the gritty garage band attitude of their public image.This trio-composed of keyboardist John Medeski, drummer Billy Martin, and bassist Chris Wood-attracts an audience that often has only the vaguest notion of bebop, swing, and other jazz styles, but who are mesmerized by the raw energy and infectious rhythms that are this band's calling cards."}
{"text": "Despite these varied and formidable precedents, the most successful-and controversial-form of plugged-in improvisation in the postfusion era has been the style of music known as 'smooth jazz.'The early roots of this genre can be traced back to the 1960s, when producer Creed Taylor masterminded a series of commercial albums for the Verve, A & M, and CTI labels, presenting leading jazz artists in slick settings well suited for radio airplay and crossover sales to pop and soul music fans.One could see the new sensibility emerging in the Taylor-produced efforts by Wes Montgomery, Freddie Hubbard, George Benson, Stan Getz, Hubert Laws, Chet Baker, Paul Desmond, and other leading performers, in which every detail, from the cover artwork to the arrangements and song selection, reflected the savvy marketing conception at work behind the scenes."}
{"text": "Yet the mercantile motivations underpinning these albums did not detract from the music making, and Taylor's efforts have mostly held up well with the passing years, largely due to the high caliber of the creative talents at play and the first-class production values involved.'By 1970, rock had overwhelmed most other genres,' Taylor later recalled.'Many other jazz albums from this period looked shabby and sounded slapped together."}
{"text": "'15 Although some critics carped at the commercial elements that dominated Taylor's approach-string orchestras, cover versions of rock tunes, image-oriented covers that rarely featured the performers-the public embraced these releases with enthusiasm.In the early 1970s, Taylor's CTI was achieving sales of jazz records comparable to those generated by the major labels and inevitably inspiring imitation from entertainment industry players with deeper pockets.During this same decade, a new wave of smartly packaged crossover jazz acts enjoyed enormous success."}

{"text": "Usually the lack of connection with the jazz art form is obvious in these instances, but sometimes the matter is more ambiguous.This leads to disturbing innovations, such as the jazz event with no jazz-as fans witnessed at the 2009 Sonoma Jazz Festival, which booked Joe Cocker, Ziggy Marley, Keb' Mo', Shelby Lynne, and Lyle Lovett-all fine acts, but none of them with any ties to the music discussed in this book.As a result of such encroachments, practitioners of the core jazz tradition must learn ways of navigating, and indeed of surviving, in a world that not only marginalizes their contributions but is ready even to usurp their identifying label and confuse the next generation of potential listeners."}

{"text": "Given this dramatic extension, a period of retrenchment was not unexpected.The publication of Albert Murray's book Stomping the Blues in 1976 served as an influential attempt to recall jazz to its origins as African American music.Murray emphasized the decisive role of the blues, which had figured insignificantly in the ECM efforts, and celebrated the sense of swing, so important to the jazz tradition, yet increasingly obscured in contemporary currents of improvisation."}

{"text": "Buddy Bolden, often cited as the first jazz musician, may well be the most mysterious figure in the annals of New Orleans music.No recordings survive of this seminal figure-despite the rumored existence of a cylinder recording from the turn of the century-and no mention of his music appeared in print until 1933, two years after his death, and some three decades after Bolden contributed to the revolutionary birth of a new style of American music.Hence any assessment of his importance must be drawn from scattered and often contradictory accounts, almost all of them documented, sometimes with mixed motives, long after the fact."}

In 1877, the year Bolden was born, President Rutherford Hayes removed the last federal soldiers from Louisiana, signaling an end to the Reconstruction era in New Orleans and its surroundings.In 1881, four years after Bolden's birth, his sister Lottie, five years of age, died of encephalitis; two years later, Bolden's father died, at age thirty-two, of pneumonia."}

{"text": "Bolden would have been exposed to music not only at various social events, but also at church and in school-in fact, two of John Robichaux's musicians taught at the Fisk School for Boys, which Bolden likely attended.At some point in the mid-1890s, Bolden began playing the cornet, initially taking lessons from a neighbor, and was soon supplementing his income as a plasterer with earnings from performing.At this remove, it is hard to evaluate how much formal training Bolden enjoyed."}
{"text": "'14 It is worth recalling that the blues form was little known at the time.Handy may be lauded by his admirers as the 'Father of the Blues,' but he never encountered this style of music until around 1903, when Bolden was already twenty-five years old.Yet Jelly Roll Morton describes a blues he heard played by New Orleans resident, Mamie Desdoume, at the turn of the century."}

{"text": "For the next twenty-four years, Bolden remained at this institution, his condition deteriorating into pronounced schizophrenia.On November 4, 1931, Bolden died at the age of fifty-four-according to the death certificate, from cerebral arterial sclerosis-only a few years before growing interest in the early history of jazz would lead researchers back to this seminal figure.Although Bolden has been typically heralded as the progenitor of jazz, such simplistic lineages ignore the broader musical ferment taking place in turn-of-the-century New Orleans."}
{"text": "A number of uptown cornetists built on the foundations that Bolden and others had created, including Bunk Johnson, Joe 'King' Oliver, Mutt Carey, and later, Louis Armstrong, the greatest of the New Orleans trumpeters.But jazz quickly leaped over the racial barriers that divided New Orleans in the early 1900s.Musicians who were early practitioners of this new idiom also included Creoles Sidney Bechet, Jelly Roll Morton, Kid Ory, and Freddie Keppard, as well as white players Papa Jack Laine, Emmett Hardy, Sharkey Bonano, and Nick LaRocca."}
{"text": "Musicians who were early practitioners of this new idiom also included Creoles Sidney Bechet, Jelly Roll Morton, Kid Ory, and Freddie Keppard, as well as white players Papa Jack Laine, Emmett Hardy, Sharkey Bonano, and Nick LaRocca.By the 1920s, when the first recordings of a wide range of New Orleans jazz ensembles were made, the ethnic mix of the local bands was almost as diverse as the city's population.Certainly jazz remained primarily an African American contribution to the city's- and, eventually, the nation's-culture; but like all such contributions, once given, it no longer remained the exclusive property of the giver."}
{"text": "And, as with so many of the loaded issues in the story of the music, the question of race lies at the core of the dispute.Raised in New Orleans, these five instrumentalists-leader and cornetist Nick LaRocca, clarinetist Larry Shields, trombonist Eddie Edwards, drummer Tony Sbarbaro, and pianist Henry Ragas-joined forces and performed in Chicago in 1916, then opened in New York in January 1917.During an engagement at Reisenweber's Restaurant, the group attracted large audiences with its novel and spirited music, and spurred the interest of East Coast recording companies."}
{"text": "LaRocca and his apologists have offered a stridently revisionist history that places the ODJB as key contributors to the creation of jazz . In contrast, critics of the band have attacked its playing as stiff and unconvincing, some going so far as to claim that it did not play jazz at all, just a raucous variant of ragtime.Others have looked for earlier examples of recorded jazz in their attempt to dislodge the ODJB from their place in the jazz pantheon, often tendentiously striving to classify the 1913-14 sides by James Europe's Society Orchestra as the true maiden voyage of the new musical style, or else hypothesizing about lost recordings by Bolden and others.Any fair assessment of this controversial band needs to tread cautiously through the exaggerations made on both sides."}
{"text": "In their travels, the band members were among the first global ambassadors for hot music; they moved from New York to England, where they gave a private command performance for the royal family, and also journeyed to France, where they helped celebrate the signing of the Treaty of Versailles.The group disbanded in 1925 but rejoined forces briefly in 1936 to record again for the Victor label and go on tour, but this reunion proved short lived.LaRocca would survive another quarter of a century, and though he no longer performed on the horn, he worked tirelessly as an advocate arguing for the ensemble's historical importance."}
{"text": "Scott Fitzgerald's Jay Gatsby, Morton had a flair for rewriting his life story to match the dimensions of his ego.He sometimes gave his birthdate as 1885-like many early New Orleans players, adding to his age to strengthen his case for being present at the birth of jazz-and stated that his original name was Ferdinand LaMenthe.In fact, Jelly Roll was born in or around New Orleans in 1890, as Ferdinand Joseph LaMothe, and was raised in a strict Creole environment that strenuously resisted assimilation into New Orleans's black population."}

{"text": "Rather than regretting the low-life associations of the District, Morton luxuriated in the company of pimps, prostitutes, murderers, gamblers, pool sharks, and dealers and hustlers of various sorts, and at times could rely on a few of these trades himself.At some point in the early 1900s-Morton claimed 1902, although this seems too early, given his birthdate-he began working as a musician in Storyville.His great-grandmother expelled him from home when she learned of his activities in the District, and before long Morton started on the peripatetic freelancing that would occupy most of his life."}

{"text": "His skills as a pianist and composer were no doubt refined during these years, but Morton's income at this time almost certainly relied more on his activities as a procurer and pool shark.However, when he returned to Chicago around 1923, Morton was well prepared to draw on his considerable talents for self-promotion in building a musical career.Certainly the time was ripe."}
{"text": "The Jazz Age had begun in earnest, and Morton looked to capitalize on the public's insatiable demand for this new style of music.Morton's Chicago years, which lasted until 1926, constitute the most prolific musical period of his career.He made over one hundred recordings or piano rolls of his compositions, published a steady stream of pieces, and formed his most famous ensemble, the Red Hot Peppers."}
{"text": "Sometimes Morton used even more dramatic means to keep his musicians on track.A telling anecdote from the 1920s describes a recording session at which trombonist Zue Robertson refused to play the melody of one of Morton's pieces the way the composer wanted.Morton took a large pistol from his pocket and placed it on top of the piano."}
{"text": "Morton took a large pistol from his pocket and placed it on top of the piano.On the next take, Robertson played the melody note for note . Morton's 1926 recording of his 'Sidewalk Blues' testifies to the results achieved by this single-mindedness.This leads directly into a twelve-bar cornet melody statement over blues harmonies supported by a stop-time vamp."}
{"text": "This structural complexity is not arbitrary, but essential to Morton's maximalist aesthetic.In his September 1926 version of 'Black Bottom Stomp,' another telling example of this approach, the band disappears midway through the piece, leaving the leader to keep the music flowing with a blistering, two-fisted stomp, which Jelly ardently attacks as though it were the star soloist's cadenza in a classical concerto.But, in a flash, the Red Hot Peppers are back, this time supporting cornetist George Mitchell in a heated stop-time chorus."}
{"text": "Nonetheless, in terms of overall artistry, Morton's achievements were considerable.These 1926 Victor recordings find Morton at the peak of his creative powers.In performances such as 'Sidewalk Blues,' 'Black Bottom Stomp,' 'Dead Man Blues,' 'Grandpa's Spells,' 'Smokehouse Blues,' and 'The Chant,' he tilled a fertile middle ground between the rigid compositional structures of ragtime and the spontaneous vivacity of jazz improvisation."}
{"text": "Although his artistic vision dominates these sides, Morton benefited from the presence of a seasoned group of New Orleans players.Trombonist Kid Ory, a Creole born in LaPlace, Louisiana, at some point between 1886 and 1890, had been a successful bandleader in New Orleans before taking his music on the road.In Los Angeles, in 1922, his band released the first New Orleans jazz recording featuring black musicians, and in 1925 he moved to Chicago where he participated in several of the most important studio dates in jazz history, working not only with Morton on the seminal Red Hot Peppers dates, but also recording with Louis Armstrong and King Oliver, among others."}

{"text": "This exodus was anything but a purely musical phenomenon.Between the years 1916 and 1919, a half-million African Americans left the South for more tolerant communities in the North, with almost one million more following in their wake in the 1920s.This vast population shift, which has since come to be known as the Great Migration, encompassed the whole range of black society, from doctors and lawyers to musicians and ministers, from teachers and merchants to artisans and manual laborers."}

{"text": "The collaboration between Jelly Roll Morton and the New Orleans Rhythm Kings, a Chicago-based unit of white Louisiana instrumentalists, was the occasion for this signal event, the first interracial session in the history of Chicago jazz.The Rhythm Kings had already undertaken recording sessions in August 1922 and March 1923 when, in July 1923, they engaged Morton to serve as pianist and composer for a follow-up date.'We did our best to copy the colored music we'd heard at home,' group organizer Paul Mares later recalled."}

{"text": "Oliver's work retained the influence of these ensembles to the end, as shown by the marchlike elements in performances such as 'High Society' and 'Snake Rag.'In 1918, Oliver left New Orleans, and over the next several years he performed not only in Chicago but as far away as California.In 1921, Oliver returned to Chicago, where his Creole Jazz Band drew an enthusiastic following, among both musicians and the general public, during an extended stint at Lincoln Gardens, a dance hall on East Thirty-first Street."}

{"text": "Even within his own lifetime, the mythic elements in Armstrong's biography began crowding out the facts.This conflation of truth and error begins literally with the details of his birth-usually given, by Armstrong and many later commentators, as the Fourth of July in the year 1900.One could hardly imagine a more fitting birthday for a legendary American figure, combining as it does both a symbolic commemoration of national independence and the dawn of the American century."}
{"text": "The next turning point in Armstrong's biography has also taken on the overtones of popular legend in narrative accounts of his life and times.Shortly after midnight on January 1, 1913, Armstrong was arrested for disturbing the peace.Armstrong was placed in the Colored Waif's Home for Boys, where he remained for eighteen months."}
{"text": "In this setting, Armstrong steadily moved up the ranks, first playing tambourine, then alto horn, next bugle, and finally cornet.At the time of his release, into his father's custody in June 1914, Armstrong was reluctant to leave the Waif's Home.But as older, more experienced brass players left New Orleans, opportunities for Armstrong to earn money as a musician were on the rise."}
{"text": "The recordings made by Armstrong's new ensemble, King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, present a number of challenges to the modern-day listener.The most obvious one stems from the poor sound quality of circa 1923 acoustic recordings.This technology, while acceptable in capturing the sound of a single instrument or a human voice, was decidedly weak in presenting the delicate balance between different instruments in a jazz band."}
{"text": "In the context of his later recordings, with their emphasis on solo playing, his charismatic and heroic stance is an asset, but in the setting of the Creole Jazz Band it disrupts the seamless blending of instrumental voices that is the crowning glory of the early New Orleans style.Here we encounter one of the grand ironies of jazz history-and a telling reminder of the rapid pace of change in the music's development-namely that, because of Armstrong's presence, the King Oliver recordings from the early 1920s stand out both as a paramount example of the New Orleans collective style and also anticipate its obsolescence, already hinting at the more individualistic ethos that would replace it.The passing of the baton from Oliver to Armstrong also marks another decisive turning point in the history of American music."}
{"text": "What an Armstrong or Johnson plays is never just notes.By mid-1924, the core of Oliver's band had left, primarily because of the sidemen's suspicion that their leader was withholding money due them.By the time Oliver recorded again, with a new group named the Dixie Syncopators, the jazz world had changed as a result of the growing popularity of the big band format."}
{"text": "Nonetheless, Oliver might have successfully weathered the transition to the big band era with this new approach had not his playing begun to deteriorate in the face of continual embouchure problems.By the mid-1930s, he could no longer play at all.Various letters written by the cornetist toward the end of his life, and later published, have been rightly called by jazz critic Martin Williams 'among the most moving documents which have been preserved from the past in jazz."}
{"text": "Having outlived his fame, Oliver worked long hours in menial jobs-pool-room janitor, roadside vendor, and the like-struggling, without success, to raise enough money to purchase a railroad ticket to join his sister in New York.At his death, in April 1938, he was living in near poverty in Savannah, Georgia.Louis Armstrong, Clarence Williams, and a few other musicians were in attendance."}
{"text": "The onset of the Great Depression had a chilling effect on the jazz world, as it did on the whole entertainment industry.Record sales in the United States had surpassed one hundred million in 1927, but by 1932 only six million were sold-a staggering decline of over 90 percent.Record labels that had focused on black music-the 'race records' of the day-were especially hard hit, but no sector of the music business proved immune to the economic malaise."}
{"text": "During the same period, the growing popularity of talking movies led many theaters to halt the elaborate live shows that had previously been a staple of popular entertainment in most cities, further reducing paying jobs for musicians.Thousands of them changed careers-membership in the musicians' union declined by almost one-third between 1928 and 1934-or else remained chronically underemployed.Greater and lesser talents suffered alike."}
{"text": "Greater and lesser talents suffered alike.The end of Prohibition in 1933 transformed many speakeasies into legitimate nightclubs, but the change was hardly a positive one for most jazz players.Not only alcohol but the whole ethos and ambiance of jazz culture were demystified in the process."}
{"text": "Such a step change depended, first and foremost, on a technological shift.In 1920 the first commercial radio station in the United States, KDKA in Pittsburgh, began broadcasting.But, in its early days, this new medium lacked a wide audience."}
{"text": "But, in its early days, this new medium lacked a wide audience.In 1921, only $11 million in radio equipment was sold in the United States; by the close of the decade, annual sales had skyrocketed to over $850 million.The nature of the music business would never be the same."}
{"text": "The 'listening public' developed only gradually, as radio evolved from a novelty to a necessity for most American households.But, more than anything, the continuing poor state of the nation's economy was the single most important factor in preventing mass media entertainment from realizing its full potential in the early days of the 1930s.Even so, the American music industry during these years was a tinderbox waiting for the spark that would set it off."}

{"text": "During his freshman year in high school, Benny became acquainted with the various members of the Austin High Gang, and some part of their devotion to the jazz art may have rubbed off on him.In the summer of 1923, Goodman met and played with Bix Beiderbecke, and though the cornetist was only nineteen years old, his playing was already distinctive enough to make an impression on the young clarinetist.One hears Bix's influence very clearly on the early Goodman recording of 'Blue and Broken-Hearted.'"}
{"text": "Indeed, Goodman's mature style-with its surprising intervallic leaps, its supple yet relaxed swing, on-the-beat phrasing, and sweet tone-would retain a set of musical values similar to Beiderbecke's.Goodman's professional career, which had started in his early teens, took a major step forward when he joined the Ben Pollack band in 1925, initiating a four-year association that provided him with chances to tour and record, as well as to build his reputation in the context of one of the finest Chicago-style dance bands of the day.Goodman's work from this period is marked by his assured command of the clarinet, while the influence of various Chicago clarinetists-Noone and Teschemacher, in particular-lurks only slightly below the surface."}

{"text": "The most fruitful collaboration of these years may have been one that Goodman pursued off the bandstand.John Hammond, a Yale dropout and member of the wealthy Vanderbilt family who would come to make a career out of his advocacy for jazz music and civil rights, introduced himself to the clarinetist one evening in the fall of 1933.Hammond announced that he had just returned from England, where he had contracted to produce recordings by Goodman and others for the Columbia and Parlophone labels."}
{"text": "Above all, Hammond's relentless prodding, his championing of authentic jazz in the face of watered-down imitations, could only serve to reinforce Goodman's better instincts, and may well have precipitated Goodman's final break with the commercial music of his freelance years and the wholehearted plunge into the hotter style that would earn him the sobriquet 'the King of Swing.'Contrary to conventional accounts, Goodman's eventual triumph-signaled by his breakthrough performance at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles on August 21, 1935, a date now conventionally cited as the birth of the Swing Era-was anything but an overnight success.The groundwork for this event had been slowly put in place over the preceding months, with many setbacks along the way."}

{"text": "Two years later, Berigan, only thirty-three years old, would succumb to cirrhosis and internal bleeding-a tragic ending for an impetuous soloist who, during his stint with the band that set off the Swing Era, seemed destined for greatness.Singer Helen Ward, who joined the band in 1934, may have lacked the deep jazz roots of Goodman and Berigan, but her captivating stage presence and forthright style of singing, with its light swing and supple phrasing, contributed greatly to the ensemble's wide appeal.But just as important as the performers-perhaps even more critical in this instance-were the arrangers."}
{"text": "Guitarist George Van Eps may have lacked Stacy's skill as a soloist, but as a rhythm player he was a world-class talent.His tenure with the Goodman band was all too brief, but when he departed in 1935, he left behind a student, Alan Reuss, who was Van Eps's equal in providing inventive chordal support in a big band setting.But the most celebrated addition to the Goodman band during this period was drummer Gene Krupa."}
{"text": "But, for all these anachronisms, Krupa excelled in swinging a dance band, which he did with the energy of a dynamo.The adulation of Krupa's audience lasted only a few brief years before a 1943 arrest for the possession of marijuana precipitated a backlash.But in the years leading up to World War II, Krupa's throbbing attack defined the sound of jazz drums for most listeners."}
{"text": "Not until Count Basie put together the supple foundation for his group-utilizing the skills of Jo Jones, Walter Page, Freddie Green, and Basie himself-would a jazz orchestra boast a more swinging sound.Let's Dance lasted only twenty-six weeks before being dropped by the network in May 1935.But Goodman had already parlayed the exposure generated by the show into new opportunities."}
{"text": "In this regard, Wilson represented a halfway point between the florid virtuosity of a Tatum and the minimalistic stylings of a Basie.Wilson's work on the trio version of 'Body and Soul' from July 1935 reflects the distinctive virtues of his playing.The swinging tenths played by the left hand provide a firm harmonic foundation for the combo-so much so that the absence of a bass player is hardly noticed-while Wilson's right-hand lines ring out with pristine clarity."}
{"text": "If there was a weakness to his playing, it lay in an overuse of ornamental runs-here the Tatum influence predominates-a habit that would be exacerbated in later years, causing much of Wilson's postwar work to sound formulaic.But in the best of his early recordings-solo efforts such as his 1937 renditions of 'Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea' and 'Don't Blame Me,' the small-band projects with Goodman, and his sessions with Billie Holiday-Wilson earns respect as one of the finest jazz pianists of his generation.The association with Wilson and Henderson may have pleased jazz fans, but the general public did not embrace Goodman's big band work until the group's nationwide tour during the summer of 1935."}

{"text": "The Chicago booking, initially slated for one month, was extended to a half-year.By the time of Goodman's triumphant return to New York in the spring of 1936, his band was, without a doubt, the biggest draw in the music industry.The Swing Era was under way in full force."}
{"text": "The Casa Loma band, in particular, cultivated a small but devoted following on college campuses that would help pave the way for Goodman's later success.One of Jean Goldkette's ensembles known as the Orange Blossoms, formed in Detroit in 1927, served as the immediate predecessor of this band.The group re-formed in 1929 as a cooperative, a rare approach to organizing a band, then as now."}

{"text": "Gray inherited a band that had already focused on hot jazz, largely under the inspiration of banjoist Gene Gifford's arrangements.In October 1929, this group undertook its first recording session newly christened as the Casa Loma Orchestra.The band explored a wide range of styles, but its up-tempo charts generated the most enthusiasm."}
{"text": "But even more telling, the Casa Loma's ability to build an audience among college students and younger fans also foreshadowed the demographics of the Goodman phenomenon.Setting a pattern that has lasted until the present day, the teenagers and young adults of the late 1930s and early 1940s not only dictated the musical tastes of the nation, but did so in a manner that their parents often could not understand.With its fast tempos, extroverted solos, and unrelenting syncopations, the Casa Loma Orchestra was forging a music distinctly not for the fainthearted."}
{"text": "Swing music was taken up by the new generation, searching for its own identity, developing its own way of life.This supra-musical aspect of jazz, which we first glimpsed in the attitudes of the white Chicago jazz players of the 1920s, now became a broader cultural phenomenon with the epidemic of swing fever afflicting America's youth, circa 1935.Perhaps one goes too far to describe this shift as the Woodstock of the 1930s, but a cultural change was set in motion during this period that set the pattern for many later developments-an initial rupture between the musical tastes of the young and old that would repeat and widen to an enormous chasm some twenty years later with the advent of rock and roll."}

{"text": "Brother Jimmy offered stiff competition, however, with eleven number one hits of his own.These included the Latin-tinged tunes 'Amapola'-which topped the chart for ten weeks in 1941-'The Breeze and I' and 'Besame Mucho,' but also appealing jazz-pop fare such as 'Tangerine' and 'Pennies from Heaven,' the latter a collaboration with Bing Crosby that was the biggest-selling record of 1936.In 1939, at the height of the Swing Era, the jazz credentials of the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra were reinforced with the addition of Sy Oliver, whose arrangements had been so influential in shaping the Lunceford sound."}

{"text": "The distinct odor of public relations permeated more than just Shaw's music.Even when Shaw decided to bid adieu to the Swing Era and retire into seclusion-as he did, in grand style, late in 1939-his demands for privacy only heightened public interest.Never one to miss a tearful encore, Shaw was back in the recording studio within weeks, having spent the interim in Mexico, jamming with the locals and garnering a new repertoire of Latin songs."}
{"text": "This south-of-the-border sojourn led to Shaw's recording of 'Frenesi,' one of the clarinetist's most memorable hits.Even a 'final retirement' in 1954 proved temporary, when Shaw resurrected his orchestra some thirty years later, although now serving only as conductor and leader, with his clarinet permanently kept in its case.Burned out by the too-rapid ascendancy of his star, Shaw could not match the staying power of Goodman."}
{"text": "And, like Goodman, Shaw played a key role in breaking down the racial barriers that stultified the jazz world.His hiring of Billie Holiday in 1938, Hot Lips Page in 1941, and Roy Eldridge in 1944 gave broader visibility to some of the most deserving African American jazz artists of the day.Roy Eldridge stands out as one of the enigmas of the Swing Era."}
{"text": "Recognized by many of his peers as the greatest trumpeter of his generation, Eldridge never enjoyed much financial success as a leader, nor was he capable of staying for very long as a star soloist with a major band.His stint with Fletcher Henderson in the mid-1930s lasted only a few months.A follow-up attempt to lead an octet with his older brother, saxophonist Joe Eldridge, resulted in a number of classic recordings-'After You've Gone,' 'Wabash Stomp,' and 'Heckler's Hop' showcase some of the most impressive jazz trumpet work of the late 1930s-but little in the way of sales."}

{"text": "Although less than seven years older than Dizzy, Eldridge soon came to be seen as part of the older generation, the group of Swing Era veterans whom Gillespie and the other boppers were trying to supplant.In fact, Eldridge had taken part in some of the early bop sessions at Minton's Playhouse and, had he been so motivated, could have adapted to the new style-his mid-1950s Verve recordings with Gillespie clearly reveal that the older trumpeter was more than up to that challenge.But personal inclination kept him in the swing camp, and his later work found him recording or performing with many of the star soloists of the prewar era, such as Benny Carter, Coleman Hawkins, Art Tatum, and Johnny Hodges."}
{"text": "Despite the growing popularity of other big bands, Goodman took the various challenges to his preeminence in stride.Not only did his band win first place in Downbeat's 1936 reader's poll, but it scored a landslide victory, receiving almost three times as many votes as its nearest competitor.Other bandleaders might have grown complacent in response to these accolades, but not Goodman."}
{"text": "Always on the lookout for prime talent, he kept the band sounding fresh with a constant influx of new blood.The addition of trumpeters Ziggy Elman in late 1936 and, four months later, Harry James, provided Goodman with two world-class soloists, both of whom were also fine section players.James's brash, energetic style, set apart by his stamina and range, can be heard to good measure on 'Peckin',' 'Roll 'Em,' and 'Sugar Foot Stomp' from September of that year, the last in particular revealing the Oliver-Armstrong roots of his trumpet style."}
{"text": "Armstrong himself stepped in to steer Hampton to the instrument that would bring him lasting fame.During a 1930 Armstrong session conducted at the NBC studio in Los Angeles, the trumpeter suggested that Hampton try his hand at an unusual mallet instrument sitting in the corner of the room.'It hadn't been used for anything except incidental chime notes-the intermission signals on radio programs,' Hampton later explained . This casual encounter led to a new career for the twenty-two-year-old artist, but his big break came when Goodman stopped by, during a visit to Los Angeles in August 1936, to hear Hampton's band at the Paradise Nightclub."}

{"text": "Influences from classical music predominate, intermingled with the swing ethos from the Henderson-Mundy-Murphy tradition.In a telling development, Mel Powell, Goodman's premier pianist from this period, would come to abandon jazz for a career as an academic classical composer, studying under Paul Hindemith, teaching at Yale, and eventually earning a Pulitzer Prize in 1990 for Duplicates, a concerto he wrote for two pianos and orchestra-a piece so far afield from Powell's jazz work as to seem the product of a different person entirely.Instead, only a handful of recordings testify to his potential."}
{"text": "John Hammond, hearing of Christian through pianist Mary Lou Williams, had flown to Oklahoma City, where he found him playing for $7. 50 per week at the Ritz Cafe.Ever the matchmaker, Hammond arranged for Christian to come to California in August 1939 to meet Goodman.The clarinetist's reluctance gave way to rapt admiration after an impromptu jam, lasting almost an hour, on 'Rose Room.'"}
{"text": "Within weeks, Christian had recorded a number of solos that would be widely emulated by other guitarists, and had performed with Goodman at Carnegie Hall.Jazz fans were quick to take notice, naming Christian as Downbeat poll winner on guitar for 1939, an honor that would be repeated in 1940 and 1941.But by then his career, though barely begun, was all but over."}
{"text": "But by then his career, though barely begun, was all but over.In the spring of 1940, Christian was diagnosed with tuberculosis.Although advised to cut back on his activities, Christian found it difficult to turn down the growing number of performance opportunities now available to him."}
{"text": "In addition to his small-combo work with Goodman, he also began playing with the big band, while after hours he frequently joined the jam sessions at Minton's Playhouse, a Harlem nightclub where the bebop style was being refined by a group of forward-looking modernists.In July 1941, he was admitted to Seaview Sanitarium on Staten Island, but even there Christian's situation remained precarious.On March 2, 1942, he died from pneumonia."}

{"text": "These were late vintages of the Swing Era.On August 1, 1942, recording of jazz music came to a grinding halt as the result of a standoff between James Petrillo, head of the American Federation of Musicians, and the music industry.Petrillo insisted that the union be reimbursed for the increasing substitution of recorded music-in the form of radios, jukeboxes, and phonographs-for live performances."}

{"text": "But swing music also contributed to its own demise.The increasingly formulaic sound of the swing idiom, circa 1942-with only a few exceptional bands maintaining any degree of originality-indicated that this style was at the point of exhaustion as a dominant force in popular music.From this perspective, the rapid rise to prominence of Glenn Miller during these years served as a fitting close to the era."}
{"text": "In the interim, the pop music ethos of Miller and his heirs would reign supreme.Between spring 1939 and September 1942, when Miller joined the US Army Air Force, no band exerted a greater impact on the public's imagination.Army Air Force, no band exerted a greater impact on the public's imagination."}
{"text": "Army Air Force, no band exerted a greater impact on the public's imagination.'Moonlight Serenade,' a huge hit from 1939, showed how close to the sweet bands Miller was willing to venture.But the singular virtue of Miller's music was its sure instinct for memorable melodic lines."}
{"text": "After the outbreak of World War II, Miller enlisted in the Army Air Corp-even though, at age thirty-eight, he would have been exempted from the draft.On December 15, 1944, the bandleader's plane disappeared while flying over the English Channel.No wreckage or bodies were ever found."}
{"text": "Yet few were surprised when Goodman's interest in matching the progressive sounds of Woody Herman and Stan Kenton proved to be short-lived.By the time of his fortieth birthday, in 1949, Goodman had effectively lost interest in following the trends of the younger generation.With his later bands, Goodman maintained a strict allegiance to the Swing Era style, supplemented by his ongoing second career in classical music."}
{"text": "With his later bands, Goodman maintained a strict allegiance to the Swing Era style, supplemented by his ongoing second career in classical music.Except for a 1962 State Department-sponsored tour of the Soviet Union, Goodman rarely ventured into the limelight during the final three decades of his life.He seldom fronted a working band during this period, preferring to hire musicians for short tours or special events."}

{"text": "With homegrown audiences so plentiful, the Texas bands developed to a high degree in relative isolation from outside influences.The black theater circuit, which brought top-quality African American musical acts to many other cities, did not reach Texas until the middle 1920s.But traditional and down-home musical styles were pervasive-so much so that a distinctive blend of jazz and country emerged under the name of 'western swing.'"}

{"text": "As the effects of the Depression ravaged the music communities of other cities in the region, more and more players gravitated to Kansas City to share in the good times.By the middle of the 1930s, Kansas City had emerged as a potential rival to New York and Chicago in its concentration of outstanding jazz talent.But Kansas City jazz was much more than a matter of favorable supply-and-demand conditions."}
{"text": "In most settings, however, the ambiance of Kansas City jazz life demanded a relaxed swing, with only a subtle undercurrent of urgency.This new sense of time was accompanied by a shift in the nature of the rhythm section, a rejuvenescence that reached its fullest realization in the Count Basie band of the mid and late 1930s.Gliding over the powerful 4/4 bass lines of Walter Page, drummer Jo Jones was able to adopt a more open sound, relying less on the insistent pulsations of the bass drum, so prominent in the work of earlier jazz percussionists, instead employing his high hat as the primal heartbeat of the band."}
{"text": "In this symbiotic process, Basie, Page, and Jones collectively reengineered the nature of time and space in the context of jazz, not only putting Kansas City on the map as a major jazz center but marking a permanent shift in the rhythmic essence of African American music.Even before Basie arrived in Kansas City, stranded there in 1927 as a member of a touring show, the incipient sounds of that community's distinctive style of jazz were already in the air.Bennie Moten, a Kansas City native who had studied piano with two of Scott Joplin's pupils, initiated a decade-long recording career in 1923; in fact, Moten fronted one of the first black jazz bands to record anywhere."}

{"text": "Most of his sidemen eventually found their way into a successor group led by Count Basie.Born in Red Bank, New Jersey, on August 21, 1904, William 'Count' Basie grew up in a distinctly working-class setting.His father served as coachman and caretaker for a local judge, while his mother took in laundry to supplement the family income."}
{"text": "Much has been made of the influence of the Kansas City tradition on the modern jazz of native son Charlie Parker, but that is only one of the many links between these two schools of jazz.Glimpses of the future are everywhere apparent on the Basie recordings from the 1930s.Even an average soloist would have sounded good with this support."}
{"text": "The complementary nature of their two approaches can be heard to good effect on performances such as 'Blue and Sentimental,' 'Doggin' Around,' and 'One O'Clock Jump.'Had Evans lived longer-he died from heart failure in 1939 shortly before his thirtieth birthday-he would likely have moved out of Young's shadow and established himself as a major tenor voice.Vocalist Jimmy Rushing was primarily a ballad singer when Basie took over the band, but in time he developed a deeply personal approach to the blues."}
{"text": "A few hardy souls traveled to Kansas City to hear for themselves.In 1936, John Hammond made several visits, his interest excited by a chance hearing of a broadcast performance by the band.Dave Kapp of Decca Records soon followed, as did Joe Glaser, who left town with Hot Lips Page under contract."}
{"text": "The contribution of guitarist Freddie Green, another band newcomer, was less noticed by most listeners, but Green's presence served to solidify the already stellar section of Basie-Jones-Page.By the time the Basie orchestra began making its 1939-40 recording sessions under Hammond's supervision- which produced a series of classic sides including 'Taxi War Dance,' 'Clap Hands, Here Comes Charlie,' and 'Tickle Toe'-it had earned growing respect as one of the very best big bands in jazz.The departure of the Basie contingent took place toward the close of the great period of Kansas City jazz."}
{"text": "The departure of the Basie contingent took place toward the close of the great period of Kansas City jazz.City boss Tom Pendergast's conviction on tax evasion charges in 1939, resulting in a year behind bars in Leavenworth, signaled a move away from the fast and loose attitudes that had fueled the local economy during the Great Depression.Even earlier, as the Swing Era took off with full force in other locales, many musicians who had come to Kansas City for the opportunities it provided found ready audiences and gainful employment elsewhere."}
{"text": "Bandleader Andy Kirk, who had assumed leadership of Terrence 'T.'Holder's Dark Clouds of Joy in 1929, continued to maintain a home base in Kansas City, although his recordings and frequent road trips brought his music to the attention of a wider audience.'Until the Real Thing Comes Along' proved to be a major 1936 hit for the band, and for a while Kirk boasted even greater box office appeal than Basie."}

{"text": "Since Williams's wife 'could play a little piano,' she was enlisted as a backup for the band's working keyboardist, Marion Jackson.But, as her 1930 solo piano recording of 'Night Life' makes clear, Williams was no amateur, rather a full-fledged keyboard powerhouse with a stirring two-handed attack.Although blessed with perfect pitch, good time, and a sure sense for the blues, Williams was only slowly recognized as a major talent in the male-dominated world of jazz."}
{"text": "Women had long been accepted as vocalists, but few had enjoyed successful careers as jazz instrumentalists, and even fewer managed to make records during this period.In 1939, the International Sweethearts of Rhythm, an all-female swing band, would be formed, and after a well-received debut at the Howard Theater would tour the United States and Europe, as well as record for the Victor label.But their example would stand out as a rare exception."}
{"text": "But their example would stand out as a rare exception.But from 1930 until 1942, Williams served as the main catalyst for the Kirk ensemble.Her charts, such as 'Mary's Idea' and 'Walkin' and Swingin',' were marked by a happy mixture of experimentalism and rhythmic urgency, while her playing soon earned her star billing as 'The Lady Who Swings the Band.'"}

{"text": "As such daring gestures made clear, none of the Kansas City pioneers brought a broader perspective to their music making than Mary Lou Williams.But the most influential of the Kansas City players from the 1930s would clearly be Lester Young, who ironically may have been the most introverted, the least focused on inspiring imitators.Redefining the role of the tenor sax was only the first of Young's achievements."}
{"text": "In espousing a new aesthetic for jazz, Young also broadened the music's emotional vocabulary, broaching an intimacy and subtle gradations of feeling hitherto unknown to the jazz idiom.Born in Woodville, Mississippi, on August 27, 1909, and raised in nearby New Orleans, Lester Young came of age in a period marked by an unprecedented blossoming of African American music in this region.Young may have had some contact with the pioneering 'hot' jazz players who were virtually at his doorstep during these formative years, yet other sources of inspiration-marching bands, minstrel shows, popular songs-apparently made a stronger impression on the child's imagination."}
{"text": "Even Lester's introduction to performing music was driven by household financial needs.In 1919, Lester's father took a job as leader of a circus band.The son, having studied the rudiments of the violin, trumpet, and drums, was soon enlisted as a sideman in the group."}
{"text": "Around the time of Lester's eighteenth birthday, he left again to join Art Bronson's so-called Bostonians, a misnomer given that this territory band worked primarily in Colorado, the Dakotas, Nebraska, and other nearby areas.In 1929, Young returned to the family band, but left again before the close of the year.By this time he had developed a fair degree of proficiency on the saxophone-he had first started playing the alto sax at age thirteen, and while with Bronson settled on the tenor as his main instrument."}
{"text": "Over the next few years, Young bounced from job to job, returning briefly to the family band, working for a period with Walter Page's Blue Devils, rejoining the Bostonians, and playing in Minneapolis, New Mexico, and a host of other locales.By 1932, Young had settled down with the Blue Devils, but that group was now in its final days.Walter Page had already left, and Buster Smith stepped in as leader."}
{"text": "Walter Page had already left, and Buster Smith stepped in as leader.In late 1933, the Blue Devils disbanded, and Young returned to Kansas City, where he played with many of the local ensembles.Already he was developing a reputation as an outstanding young saxophonist."}
{"text": "Already he was developing a reputation as an outstanding young saxophonist.But the arrival in Kansas City of the Fletcher Henderson band in December 1933 gave Lester the rare chance of testing his skills face-to-face with the most prominent tenor saxophonist in jazz.Coleman Hawkins was the featured soloist with the Henderson band, and an after-hours jam session at the Cherry Blossom provided a venue for the visiting celebrity to test his mettle against Kansas City's finest."}
{"text": "This was no small achievement.During the late 1920s and early 1930s, Hawkins had forged a powerful full-bodied approach to the tenor saxophone, one that would come to define the mainstream sound of that instrument for years to come.Incorporating elements drawn from Louis Armstrong, Art Tatum, and others, Hawkins constructed a robust, harmonically adept style."}
{"text": "The uncertain phrasing and slap tonguing of his earliest recordings had by now been replaced by a smoother legato, a ponderous tone, and a melodic gift enlivened by Hawkins's mastery of passing chords.Only a few weeks after the stock market crash of 1929, Hawkins participated in a pathbreaking interracial session as part of the Mound City Blue Blowers.'One Hour,' from this date, is an especially memorable performance, with Hawkins taking the piece at a much slower tempo than any he had attempted previously on record."}
{"text": "The result is a rhapsodic mood piece of the kind that would soon become a trademark of the tenorist.Over the next few years, Hawkins would build on this distinctive and influential approach to slow tempos, the process culminating in his iconic 1939 recording of 'Body and Soul.'Later in his career, Hawkins would typically use fewer notes in such contexts, but these early forays set a standard with their analytical probing of the popular ballads of the day."}
{"text": "Later in his career, Hawkins would typically use fewer notes in such contexts, but these early forays set a standard with their analytical probing of the popular ballads of the day.In 1932, Fletcher Henderson began advertising his star soloist as the 'World's Greatest Tenor Saxophonist.'It was a fitting title, and Hawkins was no doubt pleased at the recognition."}
{"text": "Meanwhile, Hawkins was increasingly active in other settings.In 1933, he undertook his first sessions as leader and also performed on a series of memorable sides with trumpeter Henry 'Red' Allen.The following February, Hawkins participated in an interracial session, alongside Benny Goodman, and a few days later made his last recording as a member of the Fletcher Henderson band, ending an eleven-year tenure."}
{"text": "But European participation in the jazz world was no longer merely as a passive, if receptive, audience.As Hawkins soon saw, European jazz musicians had made enormous strides by the mid-1930s.Although the vast majority were little more than imitators of models from America, a few artists of the highest order were drawing on local traditions and fusing them with jazz to create vibrant new hybrids."}
{"text": "Grappelli, for his part, thrived in this context, but this artist demonstrated, in later decades, that his violin could adapt to almost any type of setting, jazz or otherwise.Born in Belgium on January 23, 1910, and raised in a gypsy settlement outside Paris, Jean Baptiste 'Django' Reinhardt was playing professionally even before his teens.But he picked up an odd assortment of skills-in billiards, in fishing, in music-at which he greatly excelled."}
{"text": "His musical pursuits began with violin and eventually gravitated to the guitar.In 1928, Django's left hand was severely injured in a caravan fire, essentially depriving him of the use of two fingers.Yet Reinhardt's music would show few signs of compromise with this disability, other than a reliance on chords that use just two or three fingers-emphasizing sixths and ninths in a manner that has been often been imitated by later performers working in this style."}
{"text": "His rhythmic approach was equally distinctive, and the rapid up-and-down strumming style of accompaniment, known as la pompe, has become a trademark of Gypsy jazz-or jazz manouche, the French name by which it is often known.Reinhardt's earliest recordings, accompanying an accordionist and slide whistle player, are far removed from the cosmopolitan jazz of his later years, but by the time of the first Quintette session in 1934, he had come to terms with the African American idiom.On 'Dinah' he intermingles bouncy triplets and bluesy asides with forceful octaves, setting a standard for ease of execution and invention that would be amplified in later Quintette recordings such as 'Djangology,' 'Limehouse Blues,' 'Chicago,' and 'Minor Swing.'"}
{"text": "Before the war, Reinhardt had recorded with Benny Carter, Coleman Hawkins, Dickie Wells, and members of the Duke Ellington band.Ellington remained a great admirer of Reinhardt's-Duke lauded him as 'among the few great inimitables of our music' 9-and when the guitarist decided to tour the United States in November 1946 it was in tandem with the Ellington band.Here he adopted an electric guitar and performed in large auditoriums, including Carnegie Hall."}
{"text": "Returning to France, Reinhardt continued to play in small clubs and undertake occasional recordings.At his death in 1953, attributed to a cerebral hemorrhage, he was only forty-three years old.Grappelli and Reinhardt had parted ways at the outbreak of World War II, the violinist staying in England, where the band had been on tour, while Django returned to France."}
{"text": "Chu Berry, with a rough-and-tumble sound akin to Hawkins's, was among the best of these new aspirants to the throne.Berry had served in the Fletcher Henderson band in the mid-1930s before joining Cab Calloway in 1937, with whom he remained until his death in a car accident in 1941.The Calloway association paid well, but Berry's hard-swinging approach might have been better served in another setting-one wonders what magic might have resulted had Berry accepted Ellington's job offer in the mid-1930s."}

{"text": "Within days of this engagement, Hawkins matched up with a number of the other top players of his day as part of a Lionel Hampton session that also included Chu Berry, Ben Webster, Benny Carter, Dizzy Gillespie, and Charlie Christian.But the most prominent sign that Hawkins was ready to meet all challengers came on October 11 when he kicked off a series of recordings for RCA's Bluebird label with a version of 'Body and Soul' that became an instant hit with both the general public and musicians.'It's the first and only record I ever heard of that all the squares dig as well as the jazz people,' Hawkins later remarked."}
{"text": "Young's achievements with the Basie band no doubt contributed to this expanding influence, but it is in his small-combo sides that his alternative conception of jazz is most telling.His recordings with the Kansas City Six and Kansas City Seven from the late 1930s are major works.His clarinet playing from this period captures a laconic elegance, galaxies apart from the pyrotechnics of the Benny Goodman/Artie Shaw schools then in fashion, while his tenor efforts produced classic saxophone statements on 'Lester Leaps In' and 'Dickie's Dream.'"}

{"text": "The result was that Young, already introverted, became even more withdrawn, even more caught up in the odd mannerisms and jargon of his inner world.His music also changed during the 1940s.His tone thickened and at times grew coarse; the melodic lines became less sprightly; the phrases sometimes sounded disjointed."}
{"text": "Yet these were good years for Young's finances, largely due to impresario and producer Norman Granz, who utilized the saxophonist's talents in a wide range of commercial projects.In the decade leading up to his death in 1959, Young recorded and performed frequently and saw his stature in the jazz world rise in tandem with the growing respect for cool jazz.Beat generation writers would laud him, and hipsters emulated his unusual style of speaking."}
{"text": "Beat generation writers would laud him, and hipsters emulated his unusual style of speaking.One 1950s disciple, saxophonist Brew Moore, would go so far as to assert that 'anyone who doesn't play like Lester is wrong.'Of all of Young's legacies from his best years, his recordings with singer Billie Holiday hold a special position in the jazz pantheon."}
{"text": "She recrafted her life story in articles, interviews, and ultimately her autobiography.She tells of being born in Baltimore on April 7, 1915-although jazz writer Stuart Nicholson later showed that the location was Philadelphia-some three years before her parents married.In fact, the relationship between Clarence Holiday and Billie's mother, Sadie Fagan, both in their teens at the time, was a brief affair."}
{"text": "During these years, Billie was often left in the care of relatives, where she was, by turns, abused, neglected, and possibly raped.In January 1925, a juvenile court declared her to be' a minor without proper care and guardianship' and placed her in the House of the Good Shepherd for a year.When she was released, she moved back with her mother, who by now had taken up with Wee Wee Hill, a philandering porter, some eight years her junior."}
{"text": "Sadie and Hill soon moved to New York.Sometime in the late 1920s, Holiday followed them to this setting of her first musical triumphs.Little is known about Holiday's coming of age as a jazz singer."}
{"text": "But Holiday could take command of a lyric like no one else.Her 1936 recording for Brunswick,' I Cried for You'-the first standard she recorded and her biggest hit from the period-finds her wringing the tears from a song that so many other vocalists have delivered in a glib, matter-of-fact manner.Holiday interprets it as a melancholy torch song, even though the band is bouncing along at medium tempo; years later, she would grip audiences by presenting this same song as a ballad."}
{"text": "Holiday interprets it as a melancholy torch song, even though the band is bouncing along at medium tempo; years later, she would grip audiences by presenting this same song as a ballad.In 1933, John Hammond heard Holiday singing in a Harlem nightspot and gave her career a boost with a glowing review in Melody Maker, heralding her as a 'real find' and confiding that the eighteen-year-old vocalist 'sings as well as anybody I ever heard.'Later that year, Hammond arranged for Holiday to sing with Benny Goodman."}
{"text": "This same period saw Holiday slowly gain a following beyond the inner circle of jazz cognoscenti.Short stints with Count Basie and Artie Shaw broadened her audience, while Holiday's 1939 recording of 'Strange Fruit,' a disturbing song about a lynching, added to her notoriety and imparted a piquant political quality to her public image.This shift was spurred at the behest of Barney Josephson, a former shoe salesman who had recently opened Cafe Society, a fashionable nightclub in the Village."}
{"text": "Billie's singing still exuded intense emotional commitment but, as the decade progressed, the quality of her sidemen steadily declined, and later her voice followed suit.By the middle of the 1940s, subpar jazz players or maudlin violins had replaced the all-star bands of earlier years.The travails of Holiday's personal life also became increasingly public during this period."}
{"text": "Some years later, her husband Jimmy Monroe introduced Holiday to heroin.Her ensuing addiction led to a series of problems with law enforcement agencies in the late 1940s.In 1947, she was forced to serve ten months at the Federal Reformatory for Women in West Virginia."}
{"text": "Her ensuing addiction led to a series of problems with law enforcement agencies in the late 1940s.In 1947, she was forced to serve ten months at the Federal Reformatory for Women in West Virginia.But even after her release, Holiday continued to pay a heavy price."}
{"text": "Even in other locales, Holiday found club owners reluctant to book her, either because of the stigma of her addiction or a reputation for unreliability.In 1949, Holiday was arrested again on drug charges while touring the West Coast but was acquitted when she convinced the jury that she had been set up by her companion John Levy.Sales and airplay of her recordings declined during this period as well, and in 1951 Decca refused to renew Holiday's contract."}

{"text": "A Downbeat reviewer smugly joked that Lady Day was becoming 'Lady Yesterday.'In March 1952, Holiday signed with Norman Granz's Verve label and began the arduous process of rehabilitating her career as a jazz singer.Over the next five years, she would record over a hundred songs for Granz, once again in the company of world-class jazz musicians."}
{"text": "And if Holiday could be a subpar vocalist, she was never an indifferent one.Miles Davis, in an oft-quoted assessment offered to Nat Hentoff in 1958, remarked on the greater maturity in Holiday's singing.'You know, she's not thinking now what she was in 1937, and she's probably learned more about different things."}
{"text": "'10 Holiday continued to struggle with heroin addiction and bouts of heavy drinking during these final years.In 1956, she was again arrested on a narcotics charge, this time in Philadelphia.The next year Holiday appeared on a television show, The Sound of Jazz, fronting a superb band that also reunited her with Lester Young, and delivered a finely etched performance of 'Fine and Mellow.'"}
{"text": "Although beset by heart and liver problems, Holiday maintained an extensive touring schedule, including overseas appearances.At a Greenwich Village concert in May 1959, she had to be helped from the stage after singing only two numbers.A week later she fell into a coma."}
{"text": "Her legal problems, however, pursued her even into the hospital ward, with the police claiming that she was in possession of heroin and putting her under house arrest, going so far as to post agents outside the door of her room.Although Holiday responded to treatment for her liver, a kidney infection set in, and on July 17 she died.At the time of her death, Holiday's bank account showed a balance of only 70 cents, but hospital workers who came to take the body found $750 taped to one of her legs-an instinctive gesture of self-preservation by one who, so often betrayed by those closest to her, had come to trust only in herself."}
{"text": "True, Duke could compose hits, but these represented a tiny proportion of the band's output, dwarfed by the extended works, tone poems, ambitious pieces of program music, miniconcertos for his soloists, novelty numbers, blues, reconfigured evocations of stride or New Orleans style, and experimental compositions of various sorts.Sometimes these forays into new territory would produce an unexpected hit-as happened with the Middle Eastern-tinged 'Caravan,' Juan Tizol's contribution to the band from 1937.But more often, audiences were left to grope as best they could with a 'Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue' or a 'Reminiscing in Tempo.'"}
{"text": "Who could doubt that, at the crest of the public's craze for big band music, Ellington remained a reluctant participant in the mainstreaming of hot jazz?In 1936, with swing sweeping the country, Ellington recorded little and had no hits.That same year, his group fell to fifth place in the Metronome poll."}
{"text": "Over the next two years, Ellington would be involved in making over sixty small-group sides, but only one-Johnny Hodges's performance on 'Jeep's Blues'-became a featured jukebox number.In 1937, Ellington continued to take the high road with his big band work, recording the ambitious 'Diminuendo in Blue' and 'Crescendo in Blue,' companion pieces that filled both sides of a 78.His biggest-selling release of the year, however, was the previously mentioned 'Caravan,' an exotic piece with modal overtones that few bandleaders would have considered to be hit material."}
{"text": "The Ellington orchestra, with its leader now approaching his fortieth birthday, was on the brink of its greatest period, a burst of creativity that would last until the recording ban of the war years.True, Ellington would continue to record outstanding material for the remainder of his life, but the sheer number of masterpieces produced by the band between 1938 and 1942 stands out even in the context of Duke's half-century career.Three additions to the band at the close of the decade-Billy Strayhorn, Ben Webster, and Jimmy Blanton-would contribute greatly to this explosion of artistry."}
{"text": "But even before their arrival, Ellington was already increasing his output, both in quantity and quality.The year 1938 saw the band produce a number of classic sides.'Steppin' into Swing Society,' the group's first recording of the year, set the tone for Ellington's growing focus on medium-tempo swing charts, another trademark sound of the era."}
{"text": "Such works remain the closest jazz has ever approached to art song.In 1939, Ellington continued to expand his efforts on many fronts.The combo sides took a high priority early in the year, but big band activity soon picked up, with the ensemble recording over a dozen numbers in March and June, including the riff-based 'Pussy Willow,' the mood piece 'Subtle Lament,' Billy Strayhorn's first major contribution, 'Grievin',' and 'The Sergeant Was Shy' with its evocation of 'Bugle Call Rag.'"}
{"text": "He was feted by a large group of serenading schoolchildren on the occasion and he responded by recording 'Serenade to Sweden' on his return to the States.In addition, Ellington also took a higher profile as an instrumentalist during the year, recording as a solo pianist-rare at the time for Duke-and in duet format with bassist Jimmy Blanton after the latter's arrival in the fall of 1939.The addition of Blanton represented a major turning point for the band."}
{"text": "Half Ellington's age, this twenty-year-old prodigy brought a palpable excitement, an incisiveness and momentum, to virtually every performance during his brief tenure with the group.Despite his youth, Blanton's career would span months, not years-at the close of 1941 he would leave Ellington because of poor health and would die from tuberculosis the following July-but in that short time he managed not only to invigorate the Ellington rhythm section but also to revolutionize the role of the string bass in jazz.For all their virtues, they now seemed mere timekeepers, offering a steady beat and harmonic reinforcement, while Blanton was a complete jazz player."}
{"text": "With a resonant tone and a polished execution unsurpassed at the time, he laid the foundation for modern jazz bass technique.One can hear the result not only in Blanton's own recordings but in his pervasive impact on virtually all of the leading jazz bassists of the 1940s and 1950s-including Oscar Pettiford, Ray Brown, Charles Mingus, Red Mitchell, Paul Chambers, and Red Callender.'The most impressive bass player I ever heard was Jimmy Blanton,' Callender later recalled."}
{"text": "Yet Webster was just as adept at declamatory outbursts on the saxophone, leaving behind in his most famous Ellington solo, on 'Cotton Tail,' a lasting tour de force of improvisational complexity.Born in Kansas City, Missouri, on March 27, 1909, Webster developed his skills alongside some of the finest saxophonists in jazz, apprenticing in bands led by Bennie Moten and Andy Kirk.After moving to New York in 1934, Webster worked for a time with Fletcher Henderson and Cab Calloway, among others, before joining Ellington on a regular basis in 1940."}

{"text": "Ellington was also making important changes in his business dealings during this period.He parted ways with Irving Mills in 1939 and initiated a new arrangement with the William Morris Agency.Around this same time, Ellington also entered into a long-term relationship with the Victor recording label, signing a contract for five years."}
{"text": "These melodies of different length often coexisted alongside each other in a single composition, where they might be further spiced with equally unconventional introductions, codas, or interludes.Ellington's famous recording of 'Jack the Bear' from 1940 is, for the most part, a twelve-bar blues driven by the stunning bass work of Jimmy Blanton.But midway through the piece the song shifts gears into an AABA form."}
{"text": "Sometimes he might simplify matters in performance, just playing the opening sections of the work, but often he treated audiences to a full-blown version.A live recording of the band made in Fargo, North Dakota, on November 7, 1940-a neglected masterpiece on a par with Ellington's more celebrated Carnegie Hall performances or Sacred Concerts-captures a vibrant five-minute rendition of 'Sepia Panorama' with Blanton and Webster playing at absolute top form.The Fargo tracks, taken as a whole, are important documents of Ellington's 1940 band, showing that the complex and challenging pieces that were a specialty of this ensemble could also serve as spirited, hot jazz for a dancing audience."}

{"text": "At the same time, a pronounced conservatism is evident in Ellington's big band work from these years.After two decades of continually reinventing his sound, Ellington's musical vocabulary evolved little after the close of the 1940s.The melodic and rhythmic innovations of modern jazz held little fascination for him."}

{"text": "For example, virtuoso guitarist Joe Pass had spent much of his early career battling drug addiction, a struggle that found him spending lengthy periods incarcerated, at hospitals, or in halfway houses; even when he was playing music, it often was as an anonymous studio sideman or hidden in Las Vegas hotel bands.Pass's 1973 solo recording Virtuoso attracted attention for the guitarist's speed of execution and astonishing technical mastery of the instrument.Inspiring comparisons with Art Tatum and Oscar Peterson, Virtuoso justifiably ranks among the half-dozen most important recordings of modern jazz guitar music."}

{"text": "New mainstream artists began gaining notoriety alongside these veterans, with almost every style finding fervent advocates.In 1977, twenty-three-year-old saxophonist Scott Hamilton scandalized the New York scene with his 'retro' tenor sound reminiscent of Coleman Hawkins and Ben Webster and reflecting a private universe in which Coltrane or Rollins had never existed.Unlike the postmodernists, who were resurrecting old sounds with a tongue-in-cheek humor, Hamilton was dead serious about what he was doing, fostering these styles because he thought they 'sounded good'-the most anachronistic of defenses, it seemed, during this ideologically-charged period of transition."}
{"text": "Hamilton might have been an extreme case, yet such historical consciousness-raising would prove a precursor of things to come.By the dawn of the 1980s, every style and sound from the music's past seemed to find a ready audience, each one celebrated, fostered, and marketed alongside the most up-to-date offerings of the current day.The extreme diversity of the traditions that were now acclaimed indicated the tremendous scope of the music's history and the remarkable breadth of Buddy Bolden's progeny."}

{"text": "The story of his formative experiences in music is compact and impressive.Born in Kenner, Louisiana, on October 18, 1961, Marsalis had the benefit of local teachers and mentors, such as Alvin Batiste and Danny Barker, who were living exponents of the rich New Orleans jazz tradition.At age fourteen, Wynton played the Haydn Trumpet Concerto with the New Orleans Philharmonic."}
{"text": "Not since the days of Clifford Brown had a young jazz trumpeter shown such tone control or fluid execution.Listening to his featured solo on 'How Deep Is the Ocean,' recorded with the Jazz Messengers at the Keystone Korner in June 1981, one could easily imagine a spectacular future for this young virtuoso.His warm, fat tone was on exhibit in the slow introduction, and retained lucent clarity even in the fastest runs during the double-time section of the piece."}
{"text": "The music moves confidently from modal to chordal structures and into different conceptions of time, but with a fiery, unrelenting undercurrent.On the whole, these two releases represent Marsalis's most successful and fully realized attempt to expand the vocabulary of combo playing set out in the Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Bill Evans, and Ornette Coleman recordings from the 1960s.Yet at the peak of this forward-looking period, Marsalis was increasingly sounding a cautionary note."}
{"text": "The trumpeter who, as a teenager, had amazed audiences with his pure, clean tone was now exploring the 'dirtier' approach favored by prebop jazz musicians, increasingly distorting his sound with a mute.Instead of living up to his early reputation as the 'next Clifford Brown' or his midcareer tag as the bandleader who would build on Miles's work from the 1960s, Marsalis now seemed intent on reviving the aesthetic of King Oliver and Bubber Miley.At the same time, Marsalis's melody lines were becoming more compact; as he would later describe it, he was focusing on 'clarion' phrases rather than imitating saxophone lines."}
{"text": "But now the most famous young jazz musician of the day was championing the same cause.In the hands of Wynton Marsalis, jazz was coming full circle in a return to the roots that, in its own way, proved as shocking and unexpected as the earlier controversial career shifts of Miles, Coltrane, and the various jazz progressives of the 1960s.This turnaround was bound to puzzle those who had looked for Marsalis to extend the 'advances' of earlier leading jazz figures."}
{"text": "In interviews, the trumpeter had always been uncommonly blunt, not hesitating to ridicule other musicians, even some of the most famous, taking a polemical spin to questions, and frequently showing that he did not need to have a trumpet in hand to blow his own horn.'When I first came to New York in 1979 the established cats who should have been setting an example were bullshittin', wearing dresses and trying to act like rock stars,' he had once confided to jazz writer Francis Davis.'So when people heard me, they knew it was time to start takin' care of business again.'"}
{"text": "' 2 Some time later, when Marsalis tried to sit in with Davis's group at a jazz festival, Miles stopped the band cold in mid-tune and refused to continue until Wynton had left the stage.Marsalis's music in the 1990s increasingly highlighted his role as composer and section player in settings that often downplayed his skills as a soloist.His band was expanded to a septet, and this spurred an even more pronounced departure from the aggressive and uninhibited attitudes of his earlier quartet and quintet efforts."}
{"text": "Some critics complained of the exclusionary tone of the Lincoln Center proceedings, carping that those aligned with Marsalis's vision of the jazz tradition were celebrated-and financed with commissions and employment- while players whose aesthetic was too avant-garde or too European were neglected.At the height of the hostilities, which appeared to peak around the year 2000, almost anything relating to the trumpeter seemed destined to fuel the flames of contention.In some instances, Marsalis made missteps that contributed to the backlash, yet with the passing years he increasingly grew into the role of global ambassador for jazz that had been thrust upon him when he was scarcely out of his teens."}
{"text": "This concept-driven campaign, so obsessively focused on the city scrawled on an artist's birth certificate, threatened to collapse under its own weight.CBS Records, acquired by Sony in 1987, eventually parted ways with almost every one of the New Orleans artists it had signed, including Wynton Marsalis.For the most part, the musicians swept up in this Crescent City fever were genuine talents, even if the fame and expectations thrust upon them from the start were new phenomena in the jazz world."}
{"text": "Yet, as subsequent events would confirm, this flowering of the traditionalist movement in jazz was much more than a passing fad or a short-lived marketing angle pursued by the record labels.At almost the same moment that Wynton Marsalis was embracing a more traditional musical vocabulary, the National Association of Jazz, a modest organization of music professionals and teachers started in the 1960s, changed its name to the grander International Association for Jazz Education and would build its annual get-together into the single biggest event in the jazz world-a distinction it maintained until the organization's collapse from financial stresses in 2008.Equally surprising to old-timers would be the music's journey from the nightclubs of Fifty-second Street to Lincoln Center."}

{"text": "In these various settings, Threadgill's visionary music implied a rejection of existing jazz hierarchies and an egalitarian openness to a broad range of influences.After the often doctrinaire avant-garde attitudes of the 1960s, many musicians and fans welcomed this approach, one that avoided rigid adherence to any one school and celebrated the possibilities of sound over the rigidity of ideologies.These new currents would flow far beyond Chicago and New York."}
{"text": "Louis revealed a similarly expansive approach to jazz, which encompassed aspects of theater, poetry, and visual arts.On the West Coast, John Carter, who along with Bobby Bradford had formed a Los Angeles splinter group building on the avant-garde principles of Ornette Coleman, created a magnum opus of postmodernism during the 1980s with his five-volume Roots and Folklore project, which chronicled in words and music the history of African Americans.In Europe, Dutch reed player and composer Willem Breuker would pursue a similarly eclectic postmodern style with his Kollektief, which was formed in the mid-1970s."}

{"text": "Malachi Favors served as bassist for the group, but almost any stringed instrument, from banjo to zither, might show up in his hands, as well as the ever-present percussion instruments that became Art Ensemble trademarks.Indeed, the Ensemble reportedly brought some five hundred music-making implements with them when they moved to France at the close of the 1960s.The Art Ensemble caught the attention of European audiences in this new setting."}
{"text": "By the same token, Moye added a more structured and overtly polyrhythmic, often more insistent, undercurrent to the band's sound.By the time of their return to the United States in April 1971, the expanded Art Ensemble had gained a reputation as a powerful exponent of what critic Gary Giddins aptly called 'guerrilla jazz.'Their variegated approach borrowed from earlier styles while undermining them."}
{"text": "The Mandel Hall concert, for example, gyrates from fierce energy jazz to strutting backbeats and pensive interludes, interspersed with campy exhortations to the audience.The postmodernist wave of 1970s jazz found a brilliant exponent and champion in another Chicagoan, saxophonist Anthony Braxton.When viewed in its broadest outlines, Braxton's career bears a superficial resemblance to that of the Art Ensemble."}
{"text": "When viewed in its broadest outlines, Braxton's career bears a superficial resemblance to that of the Art Ensemble.Braxton too was an advocate of free jazz and an early member of AACM and, like the Art Ensemble, he moved to Paris at the close of the 1960s.His recordings have sometimes featured him alongside other AACM musicians; like them, his work crossed stylistic barriers, borrowing from a grab bag of genres."}
{"text": "' 5 Braxton's diversity is amply represented by his prolific recorded output.His For Alto from 1968 legitimized the role of solo saxophone in contemporary jazz and was the most important effort of its kind since Coleman Hawkins's 'Picasso' from the late 1940s.His Paris Concert recording with the ensemble Circle from 1971 indicated that Braxton's personal brand of abstraction could flourish in a hot-blooded jazz combo, perhaps best demonstrated by the quartet's intense reworking of the standard 'There Is No Greater Love.'"}

{"text": "Various combo recordings on Black Saint, Hat Art, and other labels have further documented the incessant probing and roving curiosity of this key figure.His recordings have never found the large audience that tuned into Armstrong or Basie or Coltrane or Davis-those ABC s of jazz popularity-but Braxton would eventually become, like many of the previous 'outsiders' of the AACM, a savvy insider, earning a coveted 'genius' grant from the MacArthur Foundation in 1994 and becoming a tenured professor at Wesleyan University.The major heroes of postmodern jazz have tended, like Braxton, to be prodigious in their output and omnivorous in their tastes."}
{"text": "But Murray would, in time, also be compared to a host of mainstream saxophone stylists-Sonny Rollins, John Coltrane, Paul Gonsalves, Eddie 'Lockjaw' Davis, Ben Webster, even Sidney Bechet-with greater or lesser degrees of plausibility.Certainly Murray's career, as it evolved, came to reflect the growing distance between progressive jazz and freedom music, a chasm that opened in the 1970s and widened noticeably in the 1980s and 1990s.'The music has to start swinging again,' Murray remarked in a 1983 interview."}

{"text": "But much of the magnetism of their playing came from the artful balance between structure and spontaneity, between following the written scores and leaving them behind.Hemphill's health problems, including diabetes and heart surgery, ended this fruitful partnership at the end of the 1980s, but the remaining members maintained the WSQ, with Arthur Blythe, John Purcell, and other saxophonists filling Hemphill's chair in later years.Postmodern currents in all the arts have typically come to embrace the use of parody and pastiche as the ultimate tools in deconstructing inherited traditions."}

{"text": "He has written a number of cinematic scores himself, usually for independent filmmakers and often for documentaries, and his music is rich in implied visual corollaries.Trumpeter Dave Douglas first came to the attention of many jazz fans while working with Zorn's Masada group in the early 1990s.This band's blending of klezmer and avant-garde jazz could almost serve as an emblem of the self-conscious postmodern posture."}
{"text": "Yet Douglas was also recording works by Igor Stravinsky, Anton Webern, and Duke Ellington on his debut Soul Note leader date Parallel Worlds from this same period, and only a few years earlier had been playing hard-bop tunes in Horace Silver's band.His later career highlights have included a spirited tribute to Mary Lou Williams, Soul on Soul from 2000, but with almost all of the Kansas City jazz elements strangely purged from the music, and Douglas's work with his Tiny Bells trio, which started out focused on Eastern Europe folk material but eventually encompassed a vertiginous array of genres.Douglas's ability to master many vocabularies is striking, yet the range of his work is so wide that he risks comparisons not with Miles or Dizzy, but rather with those crack Hollywood studio players who can play a country music session in the morning, record a commercial jingle in the afternoon, and show up on a reggae date in the evening."}
{"text": "Guitarist Bill Frisell too has exhibited, at times, a taste for genre-hopping and pastiche, but his work more often reflects a singular focus and a rare concern, given his cultural surroundings, with preserving an individual and identifiable style.Even on his most decidedly eclectic project, Have a Little Faith-an impressive tour of musical Americana from Sousa, Copland, and Ives to Dylan, Rollins, and Madonna-Frisell's viewpoint avoids reduction into mere satirical distance, and on his Disfarmer album from 2009 he achieves a stark and moving unity of purpose that has more in common with roots music than postmodern deconstruction.Although he is quick to praise the many guitarists who have influenced him, from Jim Hall to Jimi Hendrix, his playing retains an unmistakable originality that defies any tracing of guitar licks back to original sources."}
{"text": "Jason Moran has similarly constructed a career that straddles genres and categories.This Houston-born pianist first made his name in the late 1990s as sideman with saxophonist Greg Osby, a relationship that led to Moran signing with the Blue Note label, where his releases have shown a restless urgency in which almost any type of sound-acoustic, electronic, spoken, looped-can serve as an ingredient.On Moran's compact disc The Bandwagon, a cover version of Brahms coexists with high-octane free jazz and a musical composition built around a woman speaking on her cell phone in Turkish."}

{"text": "At his most characteristic moments he builds thick and sometimes overpowering sound textures at the keyboard where the listener seems to be following an aural tropical storm, surging and abating from moment to moment, rather than a conventional solo over chord changes.Whereas in the past, jazz artists had looked to highbrow role models as ways of uplifting the art form-the Third Stream movement of the 1950s was perhaps the most ambitious program of this nature-the later postmodernists treat the work of 'serious' composers as just one more example of cultural bric-a-brac available for manipulation and expropriation.After hearing Caine's version of Bach's Goldberg Variations, where if you wait long enough almost every style of music-samba, gospel, klezmer, electronica, etc.-shows up, the listener will find it hard to remember why people got so hot under the collar when Glenn Gould played this work on the piano instead of the harpsichord."}
{"text": "So much of the power of this music derives from the shock value attendant on its violation of boundaries and transgression of norms, yet this element of surprise is harder to come by with each passing year.The juggling of different jazz vocabularies will never entirely lose its piquancy, but these mash-ups hardly have the same jolt in the new millennium that they did in the 1980s and 1990s.In the aftermath of this age of cut-and-paste, with its aural collages made from snippets of everything from Ayler to Zorn, a more earnest and focused tone seems to be coming to the fore in the art form."}
{"text": "In the aftermath of this age of cut-and-paste, with its aural collages made from snippets of everything from Ayler to Zorn, a more earnest and focused tone seems to be coming to the fore in the art form.Harlem in the late 1920s was a society precariously balanced between two extremes.The Harlem Renaissance-the name given to the broad-based flowering of black cultural and intellectual life during these years-crystallized the first of these possibilities, reflecting a forward-looking optimism and deeply felt community pride."}
{"text": "As such, Harlem in this era symbolized a coming of age for all African Americans-whether living in the North or South, East or West-who participated vicariously, if not in fact, in the formation of a community where they could exist not as a minority culture, dependent on the tolerance or philanthropy of others, but as a self-sufficient body.More than any other aspect of Harlem in the late 1920s, its intellectual currents showed how far things had progressed.Certainly there had been African American intellectuals before, but too often they had labored in isolation, if not in the face of overt oppression."}
{"text": "' 1 This second Harlem was one of harsh economics, low salaries, and looming rent payments.A 1927 study showed that 48 percent of Harlem renters spent more than twice as much of their income on rent as similarly situated white city dwellers.In this hand-to-mouth environment, a quarter of Harlem families took in at least one lodger-double the rate for white New Yorkers."}
{"text": "We sensed that the black cultural as well as moral leaders looked down on our music as undignified.' 6 In 1936, when stride piano master James P. Johnson, in hopes of winning a Guggenheim Fellowship, enlisted the help of Harlem Renaissance litterateur James Weldon Johnson, the deferential tone of the musician's letter and its acknowledgment that these two respective leaders of their spheres of Harlem had never met personally testified to this still marked separation between their worlds.Johnson, in hopes of winning a Guggenheim Fellowship, enlisted the help of Harlem Renaissance litterateur James Weldon Johnson, the deferential tone of the musician's letter and its acknowledgment that these two respective leaders of their spheres of Harlem had never met personally testified to this still marked separation between their worlds."}
{"text": "The instrument represented conflicting possibilities-a pathway for assimilating traditional highbrow culture, a calling card of lowbrow nightlife, a symbol of middle-class prosperity, or, quite simply, a means of making a living.But, with the benefit of hindsight, we tend to view the piano in Harlem of the late 1920s and early 1930s as the center of a new type of music.Harlem stride piano, as it has come to be known, stood as a bridge between the ragtime idiom of the turn of the century and the new jazz piano styles that were in the process of evolution."}

{"text": "Johnson received little encouragement during his lifetime for these efforts, and a posthumous search through his personal archives revealed numerous rejection letters from conductors and potential benefactors.Only sporadic performances in the years following Johnson's death in 1955 have saved these works from total obscurity.But Johnson's high aspirations for African American music were a harbinger of later developments."}
{"text": "Yet Thomas 'Fats' Waller did more than any of these players to bring the Harlem style to the attention of the broader American public.Born in Harlem on May 21, 1904, Waller honed his skills by drawing on the full range of opportunities that New York City could provide.His teachers included two great local institutions, Juilliard and James P."}
{"text": "Combining his talents as a pianist and his sense of compositional balance, Waller's solo works stand out as the high point of the Harlem stride tradition.While most other jazz musicians of his generation gravitated toward the big bands in the 1930s and 1940s, Waller cultivated other ambitions.His activities took him anywhere and everywhere the entertainment industry flourished, from the theaters of Broadway to the motion picture studios of Hollywood."}
{"text": "In a half-dozen areas-as pianist, organist, vocalist, songwriter, bandleader, and sideman-he made a mark that is still felt in the worlds of jazz and popular music.His successes of the prewar years were topped by a well-received 1938 European tour.In Scotland, wearing a Glengarry tartan, he dazzled the audience with a Harlem stride reworking of 'Loch Lomond' and was brought back for ten curtain calls."}
{"text": "The strain of pursuing these multiple careers may have been too much.On December 15, 1943, Waller died of pneumonia while on a cross-country train trip back to New York.At the time of his passing, he was at the peak of his popularity."}
{"text": "Around this same time, another vernacular form of African American keyboard music was making a mark on American popular tastes.Boogie-woogie, as this style was called, first came to the attention of the music industry in the 1920s but achieved its greatest popularity in the early 1940s, when the faddish sound served as the basis for a number of hit records.This musical idiom combined insistent left-hand patterns based on blues chord progressions with syncopated melody lines or block chords in the right hand."}
{"text": "More authentic examples of the idiom can be found in such recordings as Meade Lux Lewis's 'Honky Tonk Train Blues' and Albert Ammons's 'Shout for Joy.'Historians of these and other early twentieth-century piano styles-Harlem stride, boogie-woogie, and other strands of jazz and popular keyboard music-face their greatest challenge in trying to place the genre-crossing and genre-busting artist Art Tatum, whose work from the early 1930s through the mid-1950s seemed to set its own rules and follow its own evolutionary schemas.He stands out as the greatest virtuoso in the Harlem stride piano tradition-and also demonstrated his mastery, on many occasions, of boogie-woogie-yet he also did much more; as such, he remains a complex and controversial figure, one difficult to situate with any real precision in the stylistic pigeonholes commonly used in histories of modern American music."}
{"text": "By the time he had completed his heroic task of recrafting the jazz keyboard vocabulary, he had taken the various hints and ideas that had existed earlier in the African American tradition and mixed them with large doses of European classical music to form a systematic, all-encompassing vision of jazz piano.Tatum was born in Toledo, Ohio, on October 13, 1909, far afield from Harlem and the other centers of jazz activity.Afflicted with cataracts in both eyes, Tatum underwent thirteen operations in his youth, which eventually restored reasonable sight to one eye."}
{"text": "Word of mouth had brought news of Tatum's piano prowess to other parts of the jazz world.Still, the Harlem musicians were not prepared for the impact that Tatum made when he traveled to New York as an accompanist to singer Adelaide Hall in 1932.Within days of his arrival, the local piano titans had decided to test the mettle of the newcomer from Toledo."}
{"text": "Over the next three decades, Tatum recorded frequently, laying down over six hundred tracks as soloist or bandleader.Despite the many virtues of Tatum's music from the 1930s and 1940s, he remains best known for a massive recording project made under the supervision of producer Norman Granz and completed toward the close of the pianist's career.Between December 1953 and September 1956, Tatum recorded over two hundred numbers for Granz, most done in a single take during marathon sessions."}

{"text": "Somewhat less elegant but more viscerally exciting are the handful of live performances that Tatum left behind.Informal sessions recorded in the early 1940s by Jerry Newman, a Columbia University graduate student at the time, showcase Tatum in a looser, uninhibited mood at various Harlem nightspots-playing, accompanying, even singing the blues.These majestic performances, both playful and aweinspiring, give credence to the view that Tatum was at his best when playing after hours."}

{"text": "The strongest validation of this comes not from jazz critics but from the musicians themselves, who are anything but ambiguous on this account.A survey of musicians conducted in 1956 by Leonard Feather for his Encyclopedia of Jazz found a stunning 68 percent of them citing Tatum as the preeminent jazz pianist.A 1985 survey of jazz pianists conducted by Gene Lees again placed Tatum comfortably on top, suggesting that despite the passing of almost three decades, changing tastes, and the emergence of many new masters of the keyboard, Tatum had lost none of his power to astonish and inspire, and often to dismay, other practitioners of the art."}

{"text": "As in so many other aspects of the history of jazz, the intermingling of musical genres played a critical role in shaping a new idiom, and New York served as the crucible in which this fusion of styles took place.As early as 1915, the Original Creole Orchestra featuring Freddie Keppard performed in New York; its success paved the way for the more celebrated visit of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band in 1917.By the close of World War I, the influence of these jazz ensembles could be heard throughout the city at vaudeville shows, theaters, society dances, restaurants, and cabarets- indeed, almost anywhere live music was performed."}
{"text": "It could digest other musical styles, in whole or in part, all the while maintaining its distinctive characteristics.The recorded work of James Reese Europe reflects the degree to which syncopation had entered the dance orchestra vocabulary even before the 1920s.In 1912, Europe brought an African American orchestra into Carnegie Hall for a celebrated performance, silencing the naysayers-including Will Marion Cook, who predicted that the concert would be a fiasco that would 'set the Negro race back fifty years."}

{"text": "Nonetheless, the role of the Europe ensemble in supporting new popular dance styles was indicative of an important change in American tastes-and one that anticipated the later evolution of big band jazz.In the years before 1910, mainstream social dancing in America had relied primarily on European-influenced waltzes, galops, polkas, jigs, quadrilles, and the like with only occasional crossover dances, such as the cakewalk, coming from African American culture.But, by 1914, new and different dance steps were gaining widespread popularity-so much so that the Vatican felt compelled that year to publicly denounce the turkey trot and the tango."}

{"text": "The changing nature of the jazz orchestra in New York during the years following the Castle-Europe collaboration was, in many ways, dictated from the dance floor as much as from the bandstand.Fletcher Henderson, who helped define the emerging jazz big band sound in the 1920s, also drew inspiration not just from New Orleans and Chicago jazz, but even more from these currents of popular music and dance that were sweeping New York in those years.Ethel Waters, in a telling anecdote, described how she had to force Henderson to listen to player piano rolls so that he could understand how to accompany her properly on a blues recording."}
{"text": "Like Henderson, Redman was a college-educated Southerner who had found steady employment in the burgeoning New York jazz scene.In his native West Virginia, where he was born in 1900, Redman had garnered attention as a child prodigy who easily mastered the rudiments of a wide range of instruments- versatility that held him in good stead when he later undertook the blending of these different textures in his pathbreaking arrangements.In his early twenties, Redman went on the road with Billy Paige's Broadway Syncopators, playing clarinet and saxophones in addition to writing band charts."}
{"text": "For his ninth birthday he received a saxophone, and by age twelve he was playing at school dances.In 1921, Hawkins went on the road with singer Mamie Smith, who one year earlier had achieved a huge success with 'Crazy Blues,' a million-selling hit that initiated the craze for race records.But by the summer of 1923, Hawkins had left Smith and was recording with Henderson."}

{"text": "The saxophone family was still in its infancy, virtually unknown in the symphonic world, and relegated primarily to military bands.The Belgian instrument maker Antoine-Joseph 'Adolphe' Sax had patented the horn in Paris in 1846.But the intrinsic advantages of his most famous instrument-it was easy to learn, forgiving in its tone production, and relatively inexpensive to make with its simple metal body attached to a conventional clarinet-type mouthpiece-proved decisive in the long run."}
{"text": "In particular, the tenor saxophone held an especially insignificant role in jazz before Hawkins's influential advocacy.Rudy Wiedoeft had recorded on the Cmelody saxophone as early as 1916, while Frank Trumbauer's later work on that instrument was also very influential in its day.Given these predecessors, as well as the rich clarinet tradition in New Orleans and Chicago bands, few would have predicted, at the time, that the tenor would become the dominant saxophone voice in jazz-indeed, even Hawkins had begun by playing the Cmelody sax."}
{"text": "And even the lingering influence of the New Orleans style was not without its value in this new setting-a perspicacious listener can hear the later battling exchanges of sections in a jazz big band anticipated in the dueling counterpoint of individual horns in the traditional jazz of Oliver and other Crescent City pioneers.More than any other event, Henderson's hiring of Louis Armstrong in 1924 served as a catalyst in accelerating the band's evolution.Comparisons of Armstrong's solo work with Hawkins's on performances from 1924 and 1925 such as 'Money Blues,' 'Go 'Long Mule,' 'How Come You Do Me Like You Do?,' or 'Carolina Stomp' show how much the cornetist had to teach-and, equally, how much the saxophonist still had to learn."}

{"text": "The textures behind the soloists are no longer passive harmonic cushions, but extroverted lines that propel the improvisation with incisive counterrhythms.With 'The Whiteman Stomp,' from May 1927, Redman even delves into the avant-garde, crafting a highly eccentric orchestration in which fragments of musical shrapnel take flight unpredictably, coalescing into an odd type of jazz, one built on disjunction and entropy.That same year, half a world away, physicist Werner Heisenberg was articulating his famous uncertainty principle, the foundation for quantum physics."}
{"text": "This period also marks the close of Redman's formal ties with the Henderson band.In 1927, he became musical director of McKinney's Cotton Pickers, an association that continued for the next several years.Although his new group lacked the extraordinary cadre of soloists that had distinguished the Henderson ensemble, it featured two outstanding arrangers in Redman and John Nesbitt."}
{"text": "Redman also figured prominently as a saxophone soloist and singer with the band.He left to form his own group in 1931, but during an era marked by a proliferation of big bands, this unit never succeeded in rising above the level of a second-tier ensemble-although it made numerous recordings and broadcasts and stayed together until 1941.Another group that drew heavily on the same personnel, the Chocolate Dandies, was never a working band, but left behind a handful of exciting recordings that marry Redman's arrangements with outstanding solo contributions from Coleman Hawkins, Benny Carter, Fats Waller, and others."}
{"text": "These several settings allowed Redman to put together a body of work that firmly established him as a preeminent jazz orchestrator and innovator during the years preceding World War II.His recorded output was negligible in his last years, but he continued to compose, and left behind a number of extended pieces at his death in 1964 that have yet to be performed in public.Benny Carter, some seven years younger than Redman, followed a similar career path, one that included affiliations-sometimes overlapping with Redman's but more often following his departure-with Fletcher Henderson, McKinney's Cotton Pickers, and the Chocolate Dandies."}
{"text": "And, like Redman, Carter eventually gravitated toward leading his own band.Talented, progressive, eager to learn and assimilate new techniques, Carter represented the best of the new generation of arrangers who were coming into their own at the close of the 1920s.Yet Carter's versatility as an instrumentalist has often served only to obscure his substantial contributions as an orchestrator and composer."}
{"text": "Yet Carter's versatility as an instrumentalist has often served only to obscure his substantial contributions as an orchestrator and composer.This precocious young talent, born in New York on August 8, 1907, appeared to possess a telling knack for mastering each and every instrument in the band.Along with Johnny Hodges, Carter was a key figure in developing the alto saxophone as a major jazz voice, and his finest solos on that instrument are as accomplished and musical as any of the era."}
{"text": "But Carter's expertise also extended to the brass section.Hear, for example, his trumpet work on 'Once upon a Time' from 1933 or his assurance in trading fours on trumpet against Coleman Hawkins's tenor on 'Pardon Me Pretty Baby' from 1937.Nor is that all."}

{"text": "A lazy elegance marks his finest work, whether on trumpet or saxophone.In his 1940 Chocolate Dandies session, he matches up with Coleman Hawkins and Roy Eldridge in a magisterial front line, but breaks the cardinal rule of improvising by starting with climactic energy then slowly bringing down the temperature until he is gliding softly over the chords in characteristic Carter fashion.This distilled approach became especially prominent in the postwar period, when Carter resisted the dominant Parker alto sound."}
{"text": "This distilled approach became especially prominent in the postwar period, when Carter resisted the dominant Parker alto sound.On his 1961 recording of 'The Midnight Sun Will Never Set,' he displays a boplike fluidity, but retains a relaxed sense of phrasing and his deeply personal, sweet-at times almost overripe-tone.Equally noteworthy, however, is the rigorously logical development of Carter's improvisations."}
{"text": "Equally noteworthy, however, is the rigorously logical development of Carter's improvisations.In the 1950s Sonny Rollins would be lauded for showing the virtues of 'thematic improvisation,' for using his saxophone to dissect, analyze, and develop melodic material, much as a classical composer might attempt in the context of sonata form.Yet Carter's work from two decades earlier evinces a comparable mastery of thematic development."}
{"text": "Even as an improviser, he thought like a composer.After disbanding his orchestra in 1946, Carter worked for a period with Norman Granz's various Jazz at the Philharmonic ensembles, and supplemented his income with miscellaneous projects and recordings, some jazz oriented but others showing his fluency in a range of commercial idioms.By the mid-1950s, Carter's performances had taken a back seat to his work as an arranger, primarily for many of the leading singers of the day, including Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald, and Ray Charles."}

{"text": "The last major figure of his generation to remain active in jazz, Carter increasingly garnered accolades, honorary degrees, commissions, and awards-somehow both fitting and ironic given the modest and soft-spoken demeanor with which he had always viewed his own work.Despite his self-effacing comments, Carter put to excellent use the opportunities that this second wind in his career provided, and he stayed active into the new millennium-at his death in 2003, obituaries boasted that this artist had made recordings during nine different decades.Others have matched or surpassed Carter's longevity as a jazz performer, but few have written so many fine compositions so late in life."}

{"text": "Until his late teens, Ellington continued to view music as a sideline.But in 1918 he married Edna Thompson, whom he had known since childhood, and the following year their son Mercer was born.Now the responsibilities of supporting a family forced Ellington to think seriously about the career paths open to him."}
{"text": "He began booking other bands, sometimes sending out several in a night, in addition to taking on his own gigs.By 1923, Ellington had established himself as a leading light of the Washington, DC, dance band scene, and had embarked on musical associations-with drummer Sonny Greer and saxophonist Otto Hardwick, among others-that would play an important role in his future.A less ambitious man might have remained content with this comfortable state of affairs."}
{"text": "Ellington's next major personnel move confirmed the new, unusual direction he envisioned for the band.When trombonist Charlie Irvis departed in 1926, Ellington brought in Tricky Sam Nanton.As with Miley, the choice of Nanton would have been far from obvious to most bandleaders."}
{"text": "Almost from the start, listeners were drawn by the novelty of these new sounds.The earliest known review of the band, dating from 1923, praises Miley's ability to exact 'the eeriest sort of modulations and 'singing' notes heard.'Another reviewer cited Miley as 'responsible for all that slow, weird music."}
{"text": "'27 However, the initial recordings of the band only hint at the originality of Ellington's conception.As early as the spring of 1926, Ellington's ambitions could be seen in his choice to augment his small working band with additional players for record sessions; but the music still primarily reflects influences from other quarters-from Oliver, from Henderson, from the New York sweet bands.But with the November 1926 recording of 'East Saint Louis Toodle-oo,' a more vibrant and original conception jumps to the fore."}

{"text": "True, various conventional devices of the day can still be detected-the shift from an ominous minor melody to a rag-inflected major theme was a stock-in-trade of the stride school; the solos, outside of Miley's, are merely workmanlike-but the sense of a new stylistic direction for the Ellington band can be clearly heard.'Black and Tan Fantasy,' from April of the following year-the first of three Ellington versions of this composition recorded in 1927-represents a second stage in the evolution of this new sound.Once again Miley's trenchant mute work over a minor theme is used to fullest effect, but the contrasting melody in major is a strong lyrical statement, several notches above the tepidly swinging second section of 'East Saint Louis Toodle-oo.'"}

{"text": "One suspects that this was more than happenstance, but another sign of Ellington's working behind the scenes.In the spring of 1927, Ellington was poised to take the next major step in his career.He had gained a dedicated following at the Club Kentucky, had embarked upon a fertile period of composition and record-making-during the late 1920s, Ellington would take his band into the studio almost every month-and had gone a long way toward forging a style of its own."}

{"text": "We have already witnessed the symbiotic relationship between the cutting-edge popular dance styles of Vernon and Irene Castle and the music of James Reese Europe, as well as the assimilation of the cakewalk and turkey trot into the ballrooms of mainstream America.The linkages between black dance, jazz music, and the broader culture were furthered in the 1920s with the popularity of the Charleston, the shimmy, and the Black Bottom.Harlem participated in this process, and in many ways drove it, serving in the late 1920s and 1930s as the epicenter of fervent dance activity that would set the model for the next stage in this evolutionary process."}

{"text": "As the dance gained popularity with young white Americans, it became widely known as the jitterbug, although it underwent a subtle transformation in the process, with the horizontal movements of the Lindy hop taking on a more vertical, jumping motion.With the rise of swing in the late 1930s, and its acceptance by young Americans of all colors, the central role of dance in the music continued unabated.Swing music was inseparable from swing dancing, and the competitions on the floor, judged by a jury of one's peers selected from among the patrons, was as much a main event as the proceedings on the bandstand."}
{"text": "Among all these venues, the most important-the Carnegie Hall for those who could not perform at Carnegie Hall-was the Cotton Club.Opened in 1923 by Owney Madden and his gang-Owney had recently been released from Sing Sing after serving eight years for murder-the Cotton Club served as the most glamorous distribution outlet for Madden's bootleg beer business.The confluence of mobsters, money, and music may have created opportunities for Ellington, but with it came added pressures."}
{"text": "This adventurous approach to tonality, unusual in jazz or popular music at the time, would become an Ellington trademark.These remarkable passages would sometimes appear only in an introduction, as in 'Black Beauty' or, even more magnificently, in opening the second movement of Black, Brown and Beige from 1943; occasionally, they linger longer, as in Ellington's inspired vignette 'The Clothed Woman' from 1947.But, most often, these surprising interjections would surface for one or two bars in the middle of a piece, before subsiding into the fold of a more conventional harmonic sequence."}
{"text": "On top of a fairly traditional stride style he would add flourishes and asides of the most amazing sort, bursts of dissonant chords, whole-tone scales, unexpected percussive attacks, or querulous arpeggios.Ellington's solo piano versions of 'Black Beauty' and 'Swampy River' from October 1, 1928, already reveal the foundations of this distinctive school of pianism, one that echoed the stride of Willie 'The Lion' Smith and anticipated the astringency of Thelonious Monk and Cecil Taylor.But Ellington's piano skills were featured all too rarely during these years, with his band now serving more and more as a voice for his musical ambitions."}
{"text": "But Ellington's piano skills were featured all too rarely during these years, with his band now serving more and more as a voice for his musical ambitions.It is especially illuminating to compare Ellington's big band charts from the late 1920s with Don Redman's efforts for Henderson and other bands.Redman's writing is packed full with musical activity-call-and-responses, breaks, dense section work, repeated rhythmic figures, and other devices."}
{"text": "An atomistic, stream-of-consciousness compilation of devices, along the lines of what Redman attempted in his 'Whiteman Stomp' had no place in Duke's holistic music.The maturing of Ellington's compositional skills and the influx of new soloists served to buffer the impact of Bubber Miley's departure from the group in 1929.Ellington, who usually preferred to avert his gaze from his band members' various indiscretions, apparently fired Miley after the trumpeter consistently showed up disheveled and intoxicated or missed entire performances."}
{"text": "And they said, 'That's it.Duke's brass section was further reinforced during this period by the addition of trombonists Juan Tizol in 1929 and Lawrence Brown in 1932-initiating an association with Ellington that, for both, would last many years.Tizol was seldom featured in solos with the band, but he contributed 'Caravan' and 'Perdido,' two pieces that would become widely played jazz standards, as well as lesser known gems such as 'Moonlight Fiesta' and 'Pyramid.'"}

{"text": "And the critical accolades also started coming Duke's way.In 1932, R. Darrell, a conservatory-trained musician who served as critic for a number of influential periodicals, wrote a prescient and detailed study of Ellington's music, rhapsodizing over the bandleader's 'noble, spontaneous, unforced melodies which spring into being as simply, as naturally as those of Mozart or Schubert.Darrell, a conservatory-trained musician who served as critic for a number of influential periodicals, wrote a prescient and detailed study of Ellington's music, rhapsodizing over the bandleader's 'noble, spontaneous, unforced melodies which spring into being as simply, as naturally as those of Mozart or Schubert."}

{"text": "Indeed, Duke's replacement at the Cotton Club, Cab Calloway, would never inspire comparisons to Bach or Schubert, but his scat-jive vocals, epitomized in the 'hi-de-ho' call-and-response effects on his hit 'Minnie the Moocher,' delighted audiences.Calloway had led the Alabamians in Chicago and, later, the Missourians in New York, and in 1929 had appeared in the revue Hot Chocolates, before securing the coveted Cotton Club job.Incorporating a heavy dose of novelty songs and scat vehicles into a more conventional hot jazz sound, Calloway achieved a celebrity-and record sales-to rival Ellington's at the time."}
{"text": "Throughout the decade, these forays into popular music coexisted with Duke's more ambitious attempts to raise jazz to the level of art music.As early as his 1931 work 'Creole Rhapsody,' Ellington was fighting against the constraints of 78 rpm recordings, tackling a longer form that required the label to use both sides of the disc to contain this single performance.Although this piece is not wholly satisfying-the melodic material is fairly simpleminded-the structural complexity and effective shifts in mood, especially on the Victor version, clearly revealed Ellington's aspirations to extend the range of jazz music far beyond the conventions of the day."}
{"text": "Although this piece is not wholly satisfying-the melodic material is fairly simpleminded-the structural complexity and effective shifts in mood, especially on the Victor version, clearly revealed Ellington's aspirations to extend the range of jazz music far beyond the conventions of the day.If Ellington felt any doubts about his ability to develop an audience for his more serious works, the band's 1933 trip to Europe certainly put them to rest.Even before Ellington's arrival, Spike Hughes had announced in Melody Maker that 'America does not honestly know or appreciate the real treasure she possesses in Duke Ellington."}
{"text": "An exciting swing band led by Jimmie Lunceford had recently arrived in Harlem, ready to challenge Ellington for supremacy on his home turf.Organized in Memphis in the late 1920s, the Lunceford band had polished its approach during summer engagements in Lakeside, Ohio, and then built up a following in Buffalo, New York, before finally coming to Harlem to appear at the Cotton Club.Lacking the depth of soloists and originality of the Ellington band, the Lunceford orchestra compensated with exceptionally fluid ensemble work, a tightly knit rhythm section, and a repertoire of solidly swinging dance charts."}
{"text": "As a bandleader, however, he remained content to delegate much of the direction of the group to others.Will Hudson's 1934 charts 'Jazzocracy' and 'White Heat,' evoking memories of the Casa Loma Orchestra, provided Lunceford with his first recording successes.But it was left to trumpeter and arranger Sy Oliver to develop the mature sound of the group, with its winning interplay of brass, reeds, and rhythm instruments."}
{"text": "Even the heralded ensemble sound of the Lunceford band was as much a matter of individual musicianship as of arranging style.The technical facility and relaxed phrasing of the reed section-as seen, for example, in the 1935 performance of 'Sleepy Time Gal'-were unsurpassed at the time.And though the brass section may have lacked the unique musical personalities who enlivened the Ellington ensemble, the range and execution of Lunceford's individual players were beyond reproach."}
{"text": "Yet if the history books have been unkind to Chick Webb, jazz fans at the time had no doubts about his preeminence.For a famous matchup with the Goodman band, held at the Savoy in 1937, a record crowd of four thousand packed the hall, while another five thousand were turned away.'Chick Webb Defeats Ben Goodman!'"}
{"text": "proclaimed the follow-up headline in Metronome.The addition of singer Ella Fitzgerald to the band in 1934 further enhanced the group's jazz credentials and added to its popular appeal, while her vocal on' A-Tisket, A-Tasket' propelled the song to an eighteen-week stint on the Hit Parade in 1938.Fitzgerald had been discovered at age seventeen in a talent contest at Harlem's Apollo Theater and soon gained a reputation for her wide range, impeccable intonation, and sure sense of swing."}
{"text": "' A-Tisket, A-Tasket,' with its nursery-song quality, proved to be an ideal vehicle for Fitzgerald's childlike vocal style-a style that stood in stark contrast to the sultry sexuality and dark moodiness of a Bessie Smith or a Billie Holiday.When Webb died from tuberculosis in 1939, Fitzgerald took over as leader and continued in that role for the next three years, until the group disbanded in 1942.Ellington, Henderson, Lunceford, Calloway, Webb, Fitzgerald-these bandleaders represented a flowering of musical talent in Harlem every bit as vital as the community's much-heralded writers and visual artists."}
{"text": "The work of these African American musicians came to exert an influence far beyond the confines of Harlem, playing a critical role in defining the broader cultural tastes of the nation as a whole, and eventually gaining adherents overseas as well.In a very real sense, the rise of the great Harlem bands in the early and mid-1930s was a harbinger of a changing sensibility at hand.During the closing years of the decade, popular music styles would be transformed permanently by the rise of a high-energy dance style, drawing heavily from African American roots, that would come to be known as swing."}
{"text": "What would have been monotonous in the hands of any other band member comes to life under the sway of Armstrong's sure mastery of syncopation.On 'Shanghai Shuffle' and many of his other features with the Henderson band-'Copenhagen' from October 1924, 'Mandy Make Up Your Mind' from early December,' I'll See You in My Dreams' recorded a month later-Armstrong was pointing the way to a more modern conception of improvisation.In the end, his impact was decisive-for the Henderson band, for the New York scene, for the jazz world."}
{"text": "As a sideman in the Clarence Williams Blue Five, Armstrong faced off with Sidney Bechet-'the only man who,' in the words of critic Gary Giddins, 'for a short while, seemed [Armstrong's] equal as an improviser during those transitional years.' 3 Bechet, born May 14, 1897, in New Orleans, may have been only four years older than Armstrong, but he already had accumulated a world of experience since first leaving New Orleans in his late teens.In 1919, he had traveled to Europe with Will Marion Cook's Southern Syncopated Orchestra, where he dazzled audiences and won the praise of noted Swiss conductor Ernest Ansermet."}

{"text": "Bechet played the most prominent role in developing the clarinet as a mature solo voice in jazz.Other performers, no doubt, also contributed-hear, for instance, Leon Roppolo's underappreciated recordings with the New Orleans Rhythm Kings that gave notice of the instrument's potential as early as 1922-yet Bechet's role was especially influential in pointing the way toward a more melodic, linear conception of the horn, and drawing on a more expansive palette of sounds.Much like King Oliver, Bechet developed a voicelike quality to his playing, and exhibited a rare sensitivity to the potential of timbre and phrasing."}
{"text": "These skills allowed him to stand out as a premier soloist, yet-unlike Armstrong-Bechet felt equally at home submerging his melody lines in the larger ensemble.This difference in temperament between the two great New Orleans players is evident in their December 1924 pairing on 'Early Every Morn,' where they ostensibly support vocalist Alberta Hunter.Bechet's soprano work, with its mixture of high held notes and diving phrases into the lower register, blends well with the group and provides ample space for Armstrong's countermelodies."}
{"text": "Bechet flirted with big band music, and even served a brief stint with the Ellington orchestra; but, for the most part, he retained his predilection for the New Orleans ensemble style.In the early 1930s, when Armstrong adapted his music to the public's newfound preference for big bands, Bechet kept true to the earlier approach, most notably in his recordings with trumpeter Tommy Ladnier.Their work on' I Found a New Baby' and 'Maple Leaf Rag' from 1932 demonstrated, to those willing to listen, that the old style had not lost its charm."}

{"text": "Unlike some other first-generation players, Bechet's skills had not declined by the time his music had come back into favor with jazz fans.His celebrated 1939 recording of 'Summertime' is a case in point.Bechet returned to Europe in May 1949, for the first time in almost twenty years, to participate in a Paris jazz festival."}
{"text": "His celebrated 1939 recording of 'Summertime' is a case in point.Bechet returned to Europe in May 1949, for the first time in almost twenty years, to participate in a Paris jazz festival.The event was a success, and Bechet came back to France in the fall for more performances, followed by a trip to England."}
{"text": "Performing and recording dates were abundant, as were a whole range of other artistic opportunities; these years found Bechet entertaining capacity audiences at nightclubs and concert halls, and also involved in ballet and cinema projects.Shortly before his death in 1959 he even turned litterateur, completing his autobiography Treat It Gentle, a plainspoken work that many of his fans cherish almost as much as his legacy of recordings.Several months before leaving for New York, Armstrong married his colleague in the Oliver band, pianist Lil Hardin."}
{"text": "Most accounts agree that her aspirations for his career, not Armstrong's, were responsible for his break with Oliver and his decision to join Fletcher Henderson.Similarly, Hardin served as the reason for Armstrong's return to Chicago in the latter part of 1925.The stint with Henderson in New York and an ensuing tour with the band had meant an enforced separation for the pair."}
{"text": "If duties as a husband and opportunities as a sideman brought Armstrong back to Chicago, it was work as a recording star that eventually proved decisive during this period.On November 12, 1925, Armstrong entered a makeshift studio-the OK eh label's portable recording equipment was in Chicago only a few months out of the year-to undertake his first session as a leader.This date initiated a period of fertile music making, one that would establish Armstrong as the dominant jazz instrumentalist of his generation, perhaps of all time."}
{"text": "Surely no other body of work in the jazz idiom has been so loved and admired as the results of these celebrated sessions, the immortal Hot Fives and Hot Sevens.In historical importance and sheer visionary grandeur, only a handful of other recordings-the Ellington band work of the early 1940s, the Charlie Parker Savoy and Dial sessions, the Miles Davis recordings of the late 1950s come to mind-can compare with them.Certainly none can surpass them."}
{"text": "To gauge his true impact, one must go back and compare his solo work with what came before.Listen, for example, to King Oliver's stilted attempt to swing the two-bar break on his September 1924 recording of 'Construction Gang.'Halfway through his break, Oliver loses his way, unable to marry his ambitious double-time phrasing to the ground rhythm."}
{"text": "Follow-up recording dates for Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five find the bandleader even more in command.The clearest indication of this comes in the February 26 session of the following year, where Armstrong the vocalist takes charge, not only revealing his highly personal manner of interpreting a song, but also inventing-at least according to legend-scat singing in the process.Armstrong later described how, in the middle of recording 'Heebie Jeebies,' he had dropped the lyric sheet to the tune and was forced to improvise hornlike lines, built on wordless syllables, with his voice."}
{"text": "Unless the soloist possessed enormous rhythmic ingenuity, these stop-time choruses could sound tense or even clumsy; but with a master of percussive phrasing, such as Armstrong, the stop-time technique could serve as the compelling centerpiece to a performance.On two of the numbers recorded at this February 26, 1926, session, 'Oriental Strut' and 'Cornet Chop Suey,' Armstrong bursts forth with his finest stop-time playing to date, and on the latter he adds a swirling coda that was much imitated by his contemporaries.By comparison with Armstrong's work from the following year, these solos reveal slight imperfections and moments of tentativeness, but at the time they represented the finest body of jazz improvisation yet recorded."}
{"text": "By comparison with Armstrong's work from the following year, these solos reveal slight imperfections and moments of tentativeness, but at the time they represented the finest body of jazz improvisation yet recorded.Follow-up sessions from June and November 1926 find Armstrong displaying increasing fluency in the upper register of the horn, and exerting more control over his tone and phrasing.After the November session, a period of almost six months passed before Armstrong's band returned to the studio, this time in an enlarged format."}
{"text": "Armstrong's new conception of jazz, with its emphasis on the soloist, demanded just such a change.During the course of several sessions in May 1927, this expanded Armstrong ensemble showed how much the leader's conception-as well as the scope of his musical ambitions-had continued to mature in the intervening months.On 'Wild Man Blues' the old New Orleans counterpoint is all but gone, relegated to a few brief bars at the close."}
{"text": "The twenty-four-year-old Hines had come to Chicago at the close of his teens.A native of Duquesne, Pennsylvania, where he was born on December 28, 1903, Earl Kenneth Hines grew up in a middle-class black family where, as he later described it,' I was just surrounded by music.' 6 Years later, critics would characterize his distinctive approach to the piano as the 'trumpet style,' linking it to the melody lines of Armstrong, yet the roots of this technique can perhaps be traced back to his childhood, when he began his musical studies learning trumpet from his father, who worked days as a foreman on the coal docks, and piano from his mother."}

{"text": "Even during his high school years, Hines led his own trio, and by the time he left for Chicago had gigged widely in and around Pittsburgh as a piano soloist, sideman, and accompanist to vocalists.While still in Pittsburgh he heard stride pianists Luckey Roberts and James P.

{"text": "Known as the Apex Club recordings, they reflect a combination of melodic fluency and hot rhythms that was rare at the time.Noone had studied with Bechet and apprenticed with Keppard before leaving New Orleans in 1917, and later served a lengthy stint with Doc Cooke.During this period, Noone developed a clarinet style distinguished by its smooth phrasing and assured execution-one that would inspire Benny Goodman and many other players associated with Chicago jazz."}
{"text": "Their crisp clarinet-piano dialogues would stand unsurpassed until Benny Goodman and Teddy Wilson initiated a further revolution in small-combo jazz some years later.Indeed, there was only one jazz collaboration of any sort at the time to rival the Apex Club music-and that was the one Hines embarked on in late June 1928, when he joined Armstrong in the studio for follow-up recordings of the latter's Hot Five.Armstrong leads off 'West End Blues' with an unaccompanied introduction that has justly been praised over the years."}
{"text": "Especially in his singing, which he increasingly featured during the closing years of the decade, Armstrong captured the imagination of both jazz devotees and the general public.Musicians could marvel at his ability to swing the melody with his voice, to recraft a song with the same inventiveness that he brought to his trumpet work, but the irrepressible gusto of Armstrong's delivery and his instantly recognizable style, epitomized in the raspiness that increasingly marked his singing after the early 1930s, appealed to the mass market as well.As early as his March 1929 recording of' I Can't Give You Anything but Love,' Armstrong was already demonstrating his sure instinct for deconstructing the vocal line, departing radically from the melody, and singing far behind the beat in a performance that ranks among the finest early ballad recordings in the jazz idiom."}

{"text": "Armstrong's music stood out as the most dominant early influence on Billie Holiday, who carefully studied and assimilated aspects of both his singing style and trumpet work.Ella Fitzgerald was equally drawn to this same source of inspiration-her childhood friend Annette Miller recalled her, at an early age, emulating the nuances of Armstrong's 1929 version of 'Ain't Misbehavin -which helped shape her sense of phrasing, rhythm, delivery, even her choice of songs.Later singers from many different orbits, from Frank Sinatra to Betty Carter, Billy Eckstine to Anita O'Day, Louis Prima to Harry Connick Jr."}

{"text": "And, in many ways, his driving, energetic attack foreshadows the later evolution of jazz trumpet, as represented by Roy Eldridge and Dizzy Gillespie, more clearly than even Armstrong's efforts of the period.While still in his teens, Smith turned down a chance to join Ellington's band, although he made his presence felt in recording 'Black and Tan Fantasy' with that group in 1927.In 1929, Smith made a number of sides for the Brunswick label, which include some of the most fervent trumpet playing of the period, but they sold poorly at the time."}

{"text": "Armstrong thrived on the competition offered by other luminaries of the horn.He refined a crowd-pleasing bravura style during the 1930s, with many solos serving as elaborate vehicles to demonstrate his mastery, especially his skill at hitting high notes.The commercial orientation of his work became especially pronounced after the trumpeter began his long-term association with manager Joe Glaser in 1935."}

{"text": "These years also saw Armstrong broaden his audience and build on his gifts as an entertainer.In 1932, during his debut tour of Europe, he both fascinated and dismayed local musicians-one delegation even demanded to examine his horn and mouthpiece, suspecting he had doctored them to facilitate his pyrotechnics.The following year Armstrong returned, visiting England, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Holland, and, in 1934, he took an extended vacation in Paris, followed by more concerts and recordings."}

{"text": "Above all, it was also the right artistic decision, reuniting Armstrong with Hines, Teagarden, and other sympathetic fellow travelers.Armstrong's prominent role in the 1947 Hollywood film New Orleans had paved the way for this shift and contributed to the public's growing perception of him as a historical figure, as did his celebrated February 8, 1947, Carnegie Hall concert, which featured the trumpeter in traditional small combo and more contemporary big band settings.Critics and fans expressed their preference for the former, and though Glaser and Armstrong griped about throwing 'eighteen cats out of work,' the trumpeter was soon working full time in a downsized ensemble."}
{"text": "Armstrong could seemingly fit in effortlessly in almost any musical setting, jazz or popular, as witnessed by memorable collaborations with Ella Fitzgerald, Oscar Peterson, Duke Ellington, Bing Crosby, Johnny Cash, Barbra Streisand, Leonard Bernstein, and others.But he was not hesitant to confront mainstream America, as when he canceled a 1957 government-sponsored tour of the Soviet Union to protest President Eisenhower's initially tepid response to the exclusion of black students from a high school in Little Rock, Arkansas.Through it all, Armstrong retained his prominence as a public figure-even more, enlarged it to quasi-mythic status."}
{"text": "The choice of both singer and song were fitting.For this figure- described by the newspapers at his death in 1971 as the most widely known American of his day-left behind an enduring and endearing artistic legacy, marked by a world-embracing warmth and a universality that transcended musical genres and national boundaries.For Louis Armstrong, it was truly a wonderful world."}
{"text": "The phonograph record, even more than the musicians themselves, would play a critical role in disseminating the creative fruits of New Orleans jazz to all who cared to listen.Our knowledge of jazz before the early 1920s is mostly based on hearsay.But from this point on, recordings document the intricate and variegated evolution of the music."}
{"text": "The complex synergism between technologies of dissemination and the growth of African American music can only be hinted at here.Record sales had collapsed with the Great Depression, falling almost 40 percent in 1930 alone, with many listeners now turning to broadcasts, not the phonograph, for their music.Previously, the musical celebrities may have made broadcasts, but, by the late 1930s, in a telling flip-flop, the broadcasts now made the celebrities, now created the audience for live music, now set the agenda for the musical tastes of a nation."}
{"text": "In truth, the entire history of jazz finds the music periodically adapating and responding to new technologies of distribution and dissemination as they emerge.It would be hard to conceive of Bix Beiderbecke becoming a jazz musician without the intervention of technology, in this case a Columbia Graphophone that entered the Beiderbecke household circa 1918.Davenport, Iowa-where Leon Bix Beiderbecke was born on March 10, 1903-may have been, as often pointed out, a riverboat stop, albeit some thousand miles distant from New Orleans."}

{"text": "Excited by the music, Bix announced to his befuddled parents his aspiration to learn to play jazz on the cornet.At this point he had already studied the piano; as early as 1910, the Davenport Chronicle ran an article about the seven-year-old Beiderbecke who, it claimed, 'can play any selection he hears, on the piano, entirely by ear.'10 Soon he was applying this same native talent, with even greater fervor, to his new instrument."}

'10 Soon he was applying this same native talent, with even greater fervor, to his new instrument.The same mixture of precociousness and studied nonchalance marked his approach to the cornet."}
{"text": "Bix may not have mastered the dirty, rough-edged sound of a King Oliver, a style vastly influential at this stage in the history of jazz; nor do his solos burst forth with the unbridled energy that Armstrong would soon bring to the music.But they sing in a way that was unique in the context of mid-1920s jazz.Not so much played, they sound as though lofted gently from the bell of the horn, left to float in a stream of warm air."}
{"text": "These poetic comparisons may strike some listeners today as being at odds with the body of work that Beiderbecke left behind.Studio technology of the 1920s did not serve the cornetist well.'Records never quite reproduced his sound,' Pee Wee Russell has attested, with many others concurring in the judgment . Acoustic recordings, with their use of a single horn to capture music and translate it mechanically into grooves on a wax disk, present modern-day fans, weaned on the crystal clarity of digital technology, with a flattened, one-dimensional sound."}
{"text": "Like shadows in Plato's cave, these artifacts from audio's earliest days are merely indicative, not truly representative, of the absent originals.And electric recordings, launched in the mid-1920s, sound only marginally better-this innovation was slow in demonstrating its advantages, so much so that, at the time, many listeners lamented its introduction as a step backward.For a solo performance, such as a classical piano piece, or for a vocal number in which the singer was situated front center, the early recording devices proved adequate, if just barely, in conveying the essence of live music."}
{"text": "But, like sailors peering into murky waters, we find that, though we may not be able to measure Beiderbecke's genius in precise fathoms, even this indistinct ebb and flow gives little doubt that it is ever so deep and broad.Between the first and second 1924 sessions for the Wolverines, Beiderbecke celebrated his twenty-first birthday.Strange to say, though Bix was barely out of his teens, the cornetist was poised to enter the middle period of his career."}
{"text": "Before the close of the year Beiderbecke had left the band to embark on a fertile period of freelancing and experimentation.These halcyon days, which lasted from the middle of the decade to the stock market crash of 1929, witnessed much of Beiderbecke's greatest work.But this period also encompassed an exceptional flourishing of improvised music on a much wider scale, one that music historians have come to designate simply as Chicago jazz."}
{"text": "A fascination with contemporary classical music and other experimental currents is also evident among this generation of jazzmen, inspiring their adoption of esoteric harmonies and rhythms-Beiderbecke is the most prominent example, but also note Tesch's use of 6/4 in the intro to 'Liza.'These tributaries of inspiration flowed together in broadening the vocabulary of jazz during the late 1920s and early 1930s.The music was still a paean to the New Orleans sound, but it also pointed forward to the later Swing Era preferences for tighter arrangements, greater expressive range and variety, and a more pronounced separation of solo and ensemble textures."}
{"text": "Musicians of all styles, all races, all instruments came to Chicago not because of an allegiance to a certain idiom of jazz, but rather to tap the opportunities to perform and earn a livelihood that the setting offered.Sidemen in Chicago bands could earn $40 per week or more during the years following World War I-a far cry from the $1. 50 to $2. 50 per engagement a New Orleans player might have commanded during that era . In response, musicians from all regions converged on the city-a process that we have already described with regard to the World's Columbian Exposition, which drew Scott Joplin and many other rag pianists to Chicago in 1893.There were, of course, many outstanding jazz players from this period who were born or raised in Chicago-Benny Goodman, Gene Krupa, Muggsy Spanier, and others; just as many came from the suburbs or, like Beiderbecke, from other parts of the Midwest."}
{"text": "Perhaps the most obvious shift came in the repertoire of the local jazz bands.During the decade of the 1920s, popular songs and thirty-two-bar forms were increasingly used by Chicago jazz musicians, while blues and multitheme ragtime structures, so central to the New Orleans tradition, became less common.This move does not seem to have been driven by aesthetic considerations-it is hardly mentioned by the players themselves in the many memoirs and interviews from the period-but came about gradually as a response to the changing demands of audiences."}
{"text": "This move does not seem to have been driven by aesthetic considerations-it is hardly mentioned by the players themselves in the many memoirs and interviews from the period-but came about gradually as a response to the changing demands of audiences.The blues recording craze of the early 1920s had already subsided by the time Chicago jazz took off in full force, while the ragtime explosion of the turn of the century was only a distant memory.In this new world of mass marketing, jazz as a category of entertainment came to occupy a wider and wider orbit, encompassing a broad spectrum of performance styles."}
{"text": "The definition of jazz already emerges as a problem by the middle of the decade, and this too must have contributed to an expansion in the repertoire of jazz performers.Consider, for example, the featured songs from the hit 1927 movie The Jazz Singer, the first talking film, which were much closer to popular music than to jazz; or Gershwin's jazz-based classical compositions, which took the country by storm in the mid-1920s; or the success of Paul Whiteman, the ostensible 'King of Jazz,' whose song choices cut across a dizzying array of musical genres.During the Jazz Age, as the period came to be known, it seems almost anything in fashion would, sooner or later, be classified as jazzy."}
{"text": "The music was now permeated by a mythology, one that romanticized the jazz life, and celebrated its leading practitioners as defiant, rebellious youths determined to go their own way in music, as in other pursuits.Some years later, Hollywood movies glamorized a series of antiheroes-one can see early hints of this figure in the films of Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart; it found its ideal type in the 1950s with Marlon Brando and James Dean; and lingers as an enduring archetype to the present day-whose quasi-cynical American individualism engages in an uneasy dance with conventional social mores.American novelists, especially Hemingway, had already drawn inspiration from this new character type."}

Born in Goodland, Indiana, on November 16, 1905, Eddie Condon apprenticed in dance bands throughout the Midwest.In Chicago during the mid-1920s, Condon became involved with a number of like-minded players, most notably a group of young instrumentalists who would come to be known as the Austin High School Gang."}

{"text": "Austin, located to the west of downtown Chicago, was an inauspicious setting for a jazz movement.In 1922, a group of students began gathering regularly at a soda parlor located near the nondescript buff brick Austin High School.The parlor featured a windup Victrola and a pile of records."}

'19 All but Freeman had studied violin before their introduction to the jazz idiom.Within a short while, the students had formed a working band, the Blue Friars- named after the Friar's Inn, the Chicago nightspot where the New Orleans Rhythm Kings played-in emulation of the new jazz sounds they had discovered."}
{"text": "Soon he too was playing with various members of the group.The 1927 recordings by the McKenzie-Condon Chicagoans reveal the ebullient approach of these young jazz players.On 'China Boy,' Krupa's solidly swinging drum work sets the tone for this more insistent style."}

{"text": "He was also an early exponent of the xylophone, marimba, and vibraphone, played the piano, and was a superb, much underrated drummer.Many of Rollini's finest efforts from the late 1920s find him working in a sideman role, on 'Kickin' the Cat' and 'Beatin' the Dog' as a member of Joe Venuti's Blue Four; alongside Bix Beiderbecke and Frank Trumbauer on 'Three Blind Mice' and 'At the Jazz Band Ball'; and with Miff Mole on 'Feelin' No Pain.'In the 1930s, Rollini continued to refine his saxophone style, as witnessed by the effective 'Bouncin' in Rhythm' from 1935."}

{"text": "New Orleans-born Joseph Matthews 'Wingy' Manone, in contrast, adapted comfortably to the stylistic demands of Chicago although his efforts may have been distinguished less by their musical innovations than through his sure sense of the comedic and his talents as an entertainer.When the Dixieland revival took off in the 1940s, these musicians were well positioned to benefit from the newfound interest in the music's roots.Only one other white brass player of the day could approach Beiderbecke in terms of individuality and creativity."}
{"text": "The New Orleans tradition, despite its frequent use of the trombone, had done little to develop the instrument's potential as a solo voice.The melodic potential of the horn was first demonstrated in the work of Miff Mole, whose prolific recordings from the late 1920s proved that the trombone need not be relegated to a supportive role, but could stand out in front as a full-fledged solo voice.Mole's influence on Teagarden cannot be denied, yet it is likely that the Texan had already developed the rudiments of his style well before he heard Mole's work."}
{"text": "In many ways, Teagarden's playing showed a disregard of formal methods, especially in his reliance on embouchure and alternate positions rather than slide technique.Whatever his sources of inspiration may have been, Teagarden already stood out as a seasoned musician by the time of his first recordings . In 1921, while still in his midteens, he joined pianist Peck Kelley's band in Houston, which also included Pee Wee Russell.Paul Whiteman heard the group during a road stop in Houston and offered Teagarden a job, but the youngster declined."}
{"text": "Some time later, when the twenty-two-year-old Teagarden finally journeyed to New York, he brought along a half-dozen years of professional experience in a fertile jazz environment, albeit somewhat distant from the more visible currents of New Orleans, New York, and Chicago.In this new setting, Teagarden was active in the recording studio-in the late 1920s hardly a week passed without his participation in a session-and joined the Ben Pollack Orchestra.Pollack was an admirable drummer and had once propelled the New Orleans Rhythm Kings, but is best remembered for discovering young talent."}
{"text": "Teagarden displayed a sensitivity to the blues that few white players of his generation could match.On his 1929 recording with Louis Armstrong, 'Knockin' a Jug,' Teagarden initiates the proceedings with two heartfelt blues choruses that transcend the trombone-indeed, his solo lines here are more akin to the vocal work of a Bessie Smith than to either the urbane stylings of Mole or the tailgate tradition of Ory.In various other recordings from the early 1930s-'Basin Street Blues,' ' I Gotta Right to Sing the Blues,' 'Beale Street Blues,' 'Stars Fell on Alabama'-Teagarden showed that his approach to singing was very much akin to his trombone stylings."}

{"text": "Yet Norvo's skill in navigating across artificial stylistic and racial barriers merits both praise and emulation.For a time in the 1920s, saxophonist Frank Trumbauer enjoyed an influence and reputation that even surpassed that of his frequent collaborator Bix Beiderbecke.Beiderbecke eventually came to take center stage in accounts of this body of music, yet this posthumous transformation should not blind us to Trumbauer's compelling achievements."}
{"text": "'25 But the ultimate tribute to Trumbauer came from Lester Young, who adopted Tram's silky phrasing as the foundation for his own moving- and vastly influential-style of saxophone playing.'Trumbauer was my idol,' Young explained to Nat Hentoff in a 1956 interview.'When I had just started to play, I used to buy all his records."}
{"text": "But his technical mastery of the horn was never in doubt, and his finest efforts rank among the most important jazz recordings of the era.Beiderbecke and Trumbauer reached their peak on heartfelt performances such as 'Singin' the Blues' and' I'm Comin' Virginia,' both recorded in 1927, which went a long way toward establishing the ballad tradition in jazz.True, earlier hot musicians had often played slow blues, but the ambiance of such performances was much different from the purer, more fragile melodicism of these inspired BeiderbeckeTrumbauer collaborations."}
{"text": "Both Venuti and Lang, who was born as Salvatore Massaro, began studies on the violin-it was a favored instrument of European immigrants, some have suggested, since it could be easily carried along as families migrated to a new homeland-but Lang later switched to banjo and guitar.The duo played together in Philadelphia and Atlantic City in the early 1920s when both were in their late teens.In 1926, they reunited in New York and embarked on a series of important recordings."}

{"text": "To a great degree, this is because the accepted discourses relating to twentieth-century music are poorly equipped to cope with figures who straddle different idioms.For example, most chronicles of musical activity in the 1920s will draw an implicit delineation between popular music, jazz, and classical composition.Such categorizations may make the narrative structure of a music history book flow more smoothly, but much is lost in the process."}
{"text": "More than any other white singer of his day, Crosby created an intimate style of delivery, perfectly suited for an age in which microphones and recordings had replaced unamplified concert hall performances.Heard alongside Beiderbecke on Whiteman's 1927 recording of 'Mary,' Crosby clearly demonstrates his allegiance to the same cool jazz aesthetic that Bix and Tram were advocating.The main failing of these latter works is not in what they included-the arrangements themselves are smartly done-but in what they left out."}
{"text": "Those who celebrate Bix, the carefree player of pretty melodies, must struggle to reconcile such a view with this work, a remote, harsh musical landscape out of character with the mythic Beiderbecke persona.Throughout 1928, Bix's drinking excesses began to take an increasing toll, eventually contributing to a December hospitalization for pneumonia.By the beginning of 1929, Beiderbecke had returned to the Whiteman band, but sporadic problems continued to plague him throughout the year, apparently worsening in the fall."}

{"text": "Few recordings were made during this final period, and his performing opportunities were now mostly at house parties and college dates-a far cry from the theaters, auditoriums, and concert halls of his Whiteman days.The end came in New York on August 6, 1931, when Beiderbecke succumbed to lobar pneumonia, perhaps accompanied by a fit of delirium tremens.He was twenty-eight years old."}

{"text": "Although we are inclined these days to view the intersection of black and white musical currents as a theoretical, almost symbolic issue, these storied accounts of the Congo Square dances provide us with a real time and place, an actual transfer of totally African ritual to the native soil of the New World.'Congo Square may have looked like it was nothing but a party,' music historian Ned Sublette has written, 'but to play a hand drum in 1819 in the United States, where overt manifestations of Africanness had elsewhere been so thoroughly, deliberately erased, was a tremendous act of will, memory and resistance.' 1 The dances in Congo Square were a nexus where opposites collided."}
{"text": "The separation of song from dance, also pervasive among Western thinkers who deal with the arts, was equally nullified, replaced with a more intrinsically African congruence of sound and movement.These gatherings, a mixture of the ceremonial and social, further broke down barriers between secular and spiritual impulses-a firsthand account from 1808 even uses the word worship to describe them.The dances themselves, marked by clusters of individuals moving in a circular pattern-the largest less than ten feet in diameter-harken back to one of the most pervasive ritual ceremonies of Africa."}
{"text": "' 2 The appearance of this African carryover in New Orleans is only one of many documented instances in the New World.As late as the 1950s, jazz scholar Marshall Stearns witnessed unmistakable examples of the ring shout in South Carolina.The Congo Square dances were hardly so long-lived."}
{"text": "The Congo Square dances were hardly so long-lived.Traditional accounts indicate that they continued, except for an interruption during the Civil War, until around 1885.Such a chronology implies that their disappearance almost coincided with the emergence of the first jazz bands in New Orleans."}
{"text": "Such a chronology implies that their disappearance almost coincided with the emergence of the first jazz bands in New Orleans.More recent research argues convincingly for an earlier cutoff date for the practice, probably before 1870, although the dances may have continued for some time in private settings . But even after the public gatherings came to halt, the tradition of the ring shout lived on in many ways.Samuel Floyd has gone so far as to contend that the ring later 'straightened itself to become the Second Line of jazz funerals.'"}
{"text": "This dynamic, so essential to the history of jazz, remains powerful even in the present day, when African American styles of performance blend seamlessly with other musics of other cultures, European, Asian, Latin, and, coming full circle, African.The mixture of African and European culture began, of course, long before the slave dances in Congo Square-in fact, at least one thousand years prior to the founding of New Orleans in 1718.The question of African influence on ancient Western culture has become a matter of heated debate in recent years-with much of the dispute centering on arcane methodological and theoretical issues."}
{"text": "The North African conquest of the Iberian peninsula in the eighth century left a tangible impact on Europe-evident even today in the distinctive qualities of Spanish architecture, painting, and music.Had not Charles Martel repelled the Moorish forces in the south of France at the Battle of Tours in 732 BC this stylized cultural syncretism might have become a pan-European force.If not for 'the genius and fortune' of this one man, historian Gibbon would declare in The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, the Moorish fleet 'might have sailed without a naval combat into the mouth of the Thames' and 'the Koran would now be taught in the schools of Oxford."}
{"text": "' 7 The Latin tinge was already a long-established fact of New Orleans music well before the arrival of jazz on the scene-perhaps not surprising for a city that was still only around one-eighth Anglo-American in the years following the Louisiana Purchase.Around the time of Morton's birth, a massive Mexican cavalry band performed daily in free concerts at the Mexican Pavilion as part of the 1884-85 World's Cotton Centennial Exposition in New Orleans.Handy relied on it to make 'St."}
{"text": "This comparatively less rigid atmosphere helped shape attitudes and behavior patterns in New Orleans; indeed, it is hard to imagine the dances of Congo Square taking place in the more Anglicized colonies of the Americas.Less than half a century after the city's founding, in 1764, New Orleans was ceded by France to Spain.In 1800, Napoleon succeeded in forcing its return from Spain, but this renewed French control lasted only three years before possession passed to the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase."}

{"text": "Even so, the role of slave labor in the production of African American song makes for an especially sad interlude in this melancholy history.The presence of Africans in the New World, the first documented instance of which occurred in Jamestown in 1619, predated the arrival of the Pilgrims by one year.By 1807, some 400,000 native-born Africans had been brought to America,9 most of them transported from West Africa."}

{"text": "Even after family, home, and possessions were taken away, they remained.In this context, the decision of the New Orleans City Council, in 1817, to establish an official site for slave dances stands out as an exemplary degree of tolerance.In other locales, African elements in the slaves' music were discouraged or explicitly suppressed."}

{"text": "'15 Both approaches to music-one that reached out and found it in the external world, the second that drew it from the physiological characteristics of the human form-came with the African to America.In the 1930s, researchers working for the Federal Writers' Project undertook a comprehensive program of recording the memoirs of former slaves.This collection, housed today at the Archive of Folksong at the Library of Congress, provides telling insight into this distinctive African American ability-strikingly similar to native African practices-to extract music from the detritus of day-to-day life."}
{"text": "Long before the blues became recognized as a distinct style of music, it lived a subterranean existence in African American communities.The blues would not emerge as a major force in the recording industry until the 1920s, but persistent scholars have uncovered earlier traces and hints of the music throughout the former slave states going back to the nineteenth century, especially in geographic settings with a high proportion of black sharecroppers and farmworkers.Unlike jazz, which first came to the fore in New Orleans and flourished in other large cities, early blues found its most fertile breeding ground in rural areas and the most impoverished parts of the country."}
{"text": "This humble lineage is all the more ironic when one considers how much the financial well-being of the later entertainment industry in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, and elsewhere would depend on this rustic music and its many offshoots in rock, R & B, funk, and other assorted urban genres.Blues songs began appearing in sheet music form as early as 1912, none with more staying power than W. Handy's 'St. The term blues-often misused to refer to any sad or mournful tune-is more properly linked, as we see in Handy's composition, to a precise structure that has come to be known as blues form.Handy's 'St."}
{"text": "The term blues-often misused to refer to any sad or mournful tune-is more properly linked, as we see in Handy's composition, to a precise structure that has come to be known as blues form.This repeating twelve-bar pattern is typically built on three chords-tonic, dominant, and subdominant-and would later serve as the foundation for countless jazz and popular songs, as well as take on a second life in the 1950s as a widely used recipe for rock-and-roll and R & B music.When sung, as it usually was in its earliest variants, the blues also employs a specific stanza form for its lyrics in which an initial line is stated, repeated, and then followed with a rhyming line."}
{"text": "The most traditional style of blues typically relies on just a vocal line with guitar accompaniment.Handy was inspired by just such a performance back in the Mississippi Delta, when he heard a raggedy musician playing a guitar with a knife at a train station in Tutwiler, circa 1903.But this minimalist style of performance, often referred to as 'country blues,' was slow in finding its way onto recordings."}
{"text": "But this minimalist style of performance, often referred to as 'country blues,' was slow in finding its way onto recordings.Not until the late 1920s, with the commercial success of Blind Lemon Jefferson, would this music demonstrate its clout in the marketplace.Jefferson, born near Wortham, Texas, in the closing years of the nineteenth century, employed a spare, riff-oriented guitar style behind his droning and resonant vocalizing."}
{"text": "Although he was capable of raspy low tones, his voice was perhaps most admired for its thin, high tones-a stylistic device that, for many listeners, stands out as the most distinctive characteristic of the early Texas blues sound.Jefferson recorded around one hundred tracks for the Paramount label from 1926 through 1929, and his performances of songs such as 'Long Lonesome Blues,' 'Matchbox Blues,' and 'See That My Grave Is Kept Clean' continue to delight fans today.Despite the efforts of various researchers, this artist's life remains clouded in mystery, and even the circumstances of his death are a matter of contentious speculation."}
{"text": "Despite the efforts of various researchers, this artist's life remains clouded in mystery, and even the circumstances of his death are a matter of contentious speculation.Yet Jefferson appears to have traveled and performed widely before his demise in December 1929, and his fame and example paved the way for many later traditional blues artists.Paramount was anxious to build upon this success, and brought two now-legendary Mississippi blues artists to their recording studio in Grafton, Wisconsin, with hopes of making them into stars as well."}
{"text": "Long before Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan rose to fame on similar exhibitionist antics, Patton would play the guitar behind his back or between his legs, spin it round, or slap it like a drum.His 'Pony Blues,' recorded in June 1929, was a hit for Paramount, and at a follow-up session for the label Patton brought along Eddie 'Son' House, recently released from Parchman Prison, who would later inspire many important blues artists, most notably Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters.House's music was more foreboding than Patton's, and at times almost apocalyptic in tone."}
{"text": "Yet one cannot excuse Johnson himself of complicity in the diffusion of this oft-told tale.Johnson's travels started soon after he was born, the eleventh child of Julia Major Dodds, probably on May 8, 1911.As an infant he lived in various migrant labor camps with his mother and sister Carrie, or in Memphis under the same roof as Julia's husband, Charles Dodds, or with her later spouse Dusty Willis back in the Delta."}
{"text": "He may have used a half dozen or more aliases in these various settings, further complicating the task of any biographer but adding to the mystique of an artist who often seemed on the run rather than merely on the road.But of the power of his music, as documented at two sessions in 1936 and 1937, there can be no dispute.More than any other artist, Robert Johnson codified the disparate strains of the blues guitar tradition into a coherent musical vision that could be assimilated and adapted by the broader stream of American popular music."}
{"text": "Johnson was known to use his singing to seduce women, and apparently some of that seductive power lingers on in recordings that have found a surprising crossover audience.Not only have rock icons such as the Rolling Stones and Eric Clapton turned to Robert Johnson for inspiration, but their fans have also followed suit, so much so that The Complete Recordings, issued in 1990, which label execs only expected to sell a few tens of thousands of copies, eventually found an audience of millions.Johnson, for his part, never lived to enjoy the rewards of this success."}
{"text": "Johnson, for his part, never lived to enjoy the rewards of this success.He died on August 13, 1938, at age twenty-seven, apparently poisoned by a jealous husband . Many scholars have tried to link the blues convention of a singer accompanied by solo guitar back to earlier African traditions, envisioning the blues as a New World continuation of the West African performance practices associated with the griots, the musical bards of their aural-oral societies.Certainly some similarities can be seen in the two musical idioms."}
{"text": "Hence, in terms of function, the griot is perhaps closer to the singing bards who shaped epic poetry in Western cultures than to a Robert Johnson or Charley Patton, whose recorded performances reflect distinctly individualistic perspectives on the subjects addressed in their songs.Blues expert Samuel Charters undertook field research in West Africa in 1974, where he tried to document the connections between these musical currents of two continents, while other scholars have proposed linkages between American blues and the bardic tradition of East Africa, or the music of Yoruban priests or even the Islamic call to prayer.Despite these efforts, many key aspects of blues music-its distinctive bent thirds, its chord patterns, and its heady mixture of bravado and alienation- resist reduction into African antecedents."}
{"text": "'20 If the country blues tradition, with its emphasis on a solo singer, usually male, accompanying himself on guitar, shows the closest ties to these African precedents, a more acculturated variant of this music relying primarily on female vocalists would exert greater influence on early jazz.The songs of the great women blues singers of the 1920s and 1930s-sometimes referred to as 'classic blues'-would find a commercial market several years before Blind Lemon Jefferson or Charley Patton made their first recordings.While the country blues singer would take liberties with the bar lines, the classic blues vocalist would strictly follow the twelve-bar form."}
{"text": "Still other aspects of the blues were transformed under the influence of the classic blues singers.Still other aspects of the blues were transformed under the influence of the classic blues singers. '21 Unrequited love, salacious love, abused love-these now emerged even more prominently as central aspects of the blues ethos, both amplifying and sometimes countering the more general spirit of alienation, loneliness, and desolation that permeated the country blues idiom.At the same time, blues performance was now moving from the happenstance surroundings of the street corner, train station, and juke house to formally designated locations-including theaters, tents, barns, and assembly halls-where paying customers came specifically seeking name acts and their well-known songs."}
{"text": "This transformation was fueled in part by a tremendous growth in the market for blues recordings by black female vocalists.In 1920, the General Phonograph Company achieved an unexpected hit with a recording of 'Crazy Blues' sung by Mamie Smith.In its first month of release, Smith's debut sold 75,000 copies, and within a year sales had surpassed one million."}
{"text": "'22 The 'race records,' as these releases were labeled, encompassed a wide range of black musical forms, with both secular and religious material finding an enthusiastic audience.In 1926 alone, more than three hundred blues and gospel recordings were released in the United States, most of them featuring African American women vocalists.Priced at fifty or seventy-five cents, these records sold well, and by the following year the number of releases increased to five hundred."}
{"text": "To meet the growing demand, companies sent talent scouts on field trips to find and record promising black musicians.No fewer than seventeen field trips, for example, were made by record industry representatives to Atlanta during the late 1920s, while Memphis, Dallas, and New Orleans were also frequent stopping points for these song-seeking expeditions . Gertrude 'Ma' Rainey, who was born in Columbus, Georgia, on April 26, 1886, typified the first generation of blues divas.Together with her husband Will-or 'Pa Rainey' as he was sometimes called-this immensely popular artist toured the South as part of a traveling minstrel show."}

{"text": "Rainey's recordings span a scant half-decade.Like many musicians of her generation, Rainey's career was irreparably hurt by the barren economic prospects of the 1930s.In 1935, Rainey retired from performing and returned to her native Georgia, where she became active in the Baptist Church."}

{"text": "Smith soon came to surpass her teacher in the variety of her melodic inventions, her impressive pitch control, and the expressive depth of her music.However, in 1923, Smith's recording 'Down Hearted Blues' boosted her to widespread fame; the record reportedly sold over a half million in copies in a few months, and soon Smith was recording regularly and performing for as much as $2,000 per week.She toured extensively, entertaining capacity audiences in large venues-tents set up on the outskirts of town as well as in downtown theaters-in the South and along the eastern seaboard."}
{"text": "Although Smith played a prominent role in the merging of blues and popular music, her ambitions could hardly have been realized without the complementary efforts of a host of songwriters, publishers, musicians, and record producers.This evolutionary process, still making its impact felt today, exerted an especially transformative influence on American music in the years between 1910 and 1930.Even before the first blues recordings were made, the blues idiom began filtering into the mainstream of American parlor sheet music, under the influence of Tin Pan Alley songwriters such as W."}
{"text": "Although his fame as 'father of the blues'-as some have designated this composer-is an overstatement, Handy's impact as an innovator and popularizer of this new genre justifies his prominent place in the annals of American music.After moving to New York in 1917, Handy was well positioned to champion African American popular music not only as a performer and songwriter, but also as a music publisher and owner of a record company.Many of the songs written by Handy and other blues-influenced songwriters became core components of Smith's repertoire-a mutually beneficial collaboration in which Smith tapped the songwriting skills of the New York professionals and in which Tin Pan Alley profited in turn from the power and authenticity of Smith's interpretations."}
{"text": "Yet the blues has also retained a primal core that has resisted assimilation and change.When we listen to Smith in her 1925 collaborations with Armstrong on 'St. Louis Blues' and 'Reckless Blues,' we can already hear the different aesthetic sensibilities that, even at this early date, were beginning to distinguish the jazz and blues idioms.Louis Blues' and 'Reckless Blues,' we can already hear the different aesthetic sensibilities that, even at this early date, were beginning to distinguish the jazz and blues idioms."}

{"text": "In his Library of Congress recordings, Jelly Roll Morton demonstrated an illuminating comparison of two ways of playing Scott Joplin's 'Maple Leaf Rag'-one reflecting the Missouri ragtime tradition and the second showing a New Orleans jazz-inflected approach to the composition.The similarities Morton perceived between ragtime and 1930s jazz relate primarily to keyboard techniques, most notably the striding on-the-beat bass employed by the left hand and the riveting right-hand syncopations.The latter were often so predominant in ragtime that entire melody lines might be constructed out of repeated syncopated figures."}

{"text": "Scott Joplin stands out as the greatest of these composers.In fact, the resurgence of interest in ragtime that began in the 1970s would be hard to imagine if not for the timeless appeal of Joplin's music.While others may have written rags that were more technically demanding or that boasted more striking novelty effects, none could approach the structural elegance, the melodic inventiveness, or the range of expression that characterized Joplin's major works."}
{"text": "Although his more daring works never gained the acceptance, at least during his lifetime, that Joplin craved, his oeuvre stands out today all the more due to the high standards to which he aspired, as well as to his determined belief in ragtime as a serious form of music-a belief that, more than a half-century after Joplin's death, became validated by his belated enshrinement as a major American composer.Joplin was born in Texarkana, Texas, probably in 1868.His father, the former slave Jiles Joplin, had played the violin for house parties given by the local slave owner in the days before the Emancipation Proclamation, while his mother, Florence Givens Joplin, sang and played the banjo."}

{"text": "It wasn't until two years later that John Stark published the work, and over the next twelve months only four hundred copies were sold.But in the fall of 1900, the 'Maple Leaf Rag' caught on with the general public, and became the first piece of sheet music to sell more than one million copies-a figure all the more stunning when one realizes that there were fewer than 100,000 professional musicians and music teachers in the United States at the time.Amateur pianists, for their part, must have found it anything but easy to navigate the technical and rhythmic difficulties of Joplin's celebrated rag; however, many no doubt purchased the sheet music and labored over its intricate syncopations."}
{"text": "True, Joplin set high goals for himself, but his relationship to ragtime was more one of fighting against its constraints and stylistic dead ends rather than battling for its honor and glory.'Joplin's ambition is to shine in other spheres,' a 1903 newspaper article about him recounts.'He affirms that it is only a pastime for him to compose syncopated music and he longs for more arduous works."}
{"text": "It made enormous demands on the composer, not only because of the massive scale of the work, but perhaps even more from the considerable challenge of finding financial and public support for the undertaking.Around 1903, Joplin had written a first opera, now lost, titled A Guest of Honor, which apparently kept fairly close to the ragtime style.Treemonisha proved to be a far more expansive and consuming musical project."}
{"text": "Treemonisha proved to be a far more expansive and consuming musical project.As early as 1907, Joplin may have discussed the new opera with Eubie Blake, and the following year he played parts of it for Joseph Lamb.John Stark turned down the work, sensing the poor commercial prospects for an African American folk opera, and it was not until 1911 that Joplin, financing the venture himself, was able to publish the 230-page score for piano and eleven voices."}

{"text": "Under a variety of banners-some calling it traditional or trad jazz, others referring to it as New Orleans or Chicago jazz, still others preferring the term Dixieland-the sounds of older jazz styles grew ever more popular.As early as the late 1930s, the first signs of a traditional jazz revival could be seen, but this movement would not gain momentum for another decade.By then the growing antipathy to bop in certain quarters-certainly among the general public, but also among many jazz fans and musicians-made this return to the roots more than a casual indulgence of nostalgia."}

{"text": "Much of the revival music, it is true, tended toward banality-it represented the way jazz might have sounded 'if it had existed in mid-Victorian times,' quipped one critic.But, at its best, this movement was capable of creating fresh, vibrant performances, such as Wild Bill Davison's November 1943 sessions with Russell and George Brunis for the Commodore label; or Muggsy Spanier's illustrious 1939 sides, which inspired comparisons with King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band.Even Bunk Johnson's once-controversial recordings hold up well today, when one simply enjoys them for their verve and free-spirited interplay, and not as evidence submitted in support of a polemic."}
{"text": "More than any later jazz styles, the two-step syncopations of New Orleans and Chicago testified to the universal appeal of jazz music.But the most persuasive sign that early jazz was once again a major force came in 1947.In that year of bop triumphant, Louis Armstrong abandoned the big band format he had pursued for almost two decades and made a much-celebrated return to the traditional New Orleans style."}

{"text": "The 'cool' movement, as it soon came to be known, presented an especially promising alternative to the bop paradigm.Spearheaded by members of the younger generation, most of them in their early twenties at the close of the 1940s, cool jazz was-like bop-an overtly modernist music with radical implications.Its exponents shared many of the aesthetic values of the boppers-an allegiance to contemporary trends in music, a predilection for experimentation, a distaste for conformity, and a view of jazz as an underground movement-and many had served as sidemen in prominent bop groups."}
{"text": "They realized that bop was the defining style of their generation, and that even an attempt to sidestep the idiom would invariably be interpreted as rebellion against it.Davis had left Parker's band at the close of 1948, disturbed by Bird's increasingly erratic and self-destructive behavior.His new source of inspiration, arranger Gil Evans, was in many ways the antithesis of Parker."}

{"text": "The members of the Nonet would have more success as individuals in promoting the cool aesthetic than as part of a single unit.Davis would continue to refine his sound, in a variety of settings, and by the mid-1950s had developed a deeply personal conception of jazz, one that would exert enormous influence on later jazz musicians.Pianist John Lewis would build a major concert hall career as musical director of the Modern Jazz Quartet, a cool band remarkable for its longevity and popularity, as well as its consistently high musical standards."}
{"text": "Gunther Schuller, who had played French horn with the Nonet, would become a key figure in promoting the 'Third Stream'-an ambitious and controversial offshoot of cool jazz that aimed to break down barriers between classical and jazz idioms.Even hardened bopper Max Roach, the drummer on most of the Davis tracks, would bring a measured dose of the cool sensibility to his pathbreaking mid-1950s band with Clifford Brown.All in all, the Davis Nonet was much like a band of disciples, gathered together for a brief time before scattering in their several separate directions, each inspired to proselytize others in turn."}
{"text": "The roots of Lewis's Modern Jazz Quartet actually predated the Davis Nonet.As early as 1946, a predecessor group including Lewis, vibraphonist Milt Jackson, drummer Kenny Clarke, and bassist Ray Brown performed together as the rhythm section in Dizzy Gillespie's big band.This same unit later recorded as the Milt Jackson Quartet in the early 1950s."}

{"text": "Still, none of these early associations prepared listeners for the burst of creativity Lewis revealed as musical director of the Modern Jazz Quartet.Along with Schuller, he played an key role in furthering Third Stream collaborations between jazz and classical musicians; in addition to his responsibilities with the MJQ, Lewis formed Orchestra USA in the early 1960s, an unfairly forgotten ensemble that straddled a number of musical styles and idioms.Years later he would renew these ambitions, working with Gary Giddins and Roberta Swann to found the American Jazz Orchestra."}
{"text": "Years later he would renew these ambitions, working with Gary Giddins and Roberta Swann to found the American Jazz Orchestra.Lewis was also an early advocate of the jazz avant-garde and was among the first supporters of Ornette Coleman, whom he encouraged to attend the Lenox School of Jazz in 1959, at a time when most jazz players were ridiculing or ignoring Coleman's work.Lewis could find jazz material in traditions few would have thought hospitable to it- everything from fugues to commedia dell'arte-but he was equally successful at penning more recognizably jazz-oriented pieces, such as his wistful ballad 'Django' or his riff-driven 'The Golden Striker.'"}
{"text": "For want of a better title, he has been claimed as part of the cool jazz movement.Certainly he played a role in the growing popularity of cool jazz during the 1950s, but Lewis's activities were far too varied to be subsumed under any one heading.Although he never participated in the Davis Nonet, Stan Getz figured as one of the most prominent cool players of the period."}

{"text": "Getz, who was always a reluctant modernist-his embrace of bop mannerisms had never obscured the more traditional roots in his playing-seemed in danger of sounding old fashioned before his thirty-fifth birthday.But, in the early 1960s, Getz mounted a major comeback that encompassed both critical success and immense popular acclaim.His 1961 recording Focus featured Getz's sleek improvisations darting in and out of Eddie Sauter's acerbic string writing."}

{"text": "Quick to capitalize on this success, Getz released several other bossa nova recordings, as did a host of other jazz musicians, anxious to benefit from the Brazilian fad before it faded.In the summer of 1964, just when it seemed as if the public's appetite for the new sound had been sated, Getz achieved an even more celebrated hit single with 'The Girl from Ipanema.'The Getz/Gilberto LP climbed to number two on the charts, kept from the top spot only by the Beatles."}

{"text": "Of these three, only Gordon would go on to enjoy widespread fame, albeit after twenty years of relative obscurity.His early recordings for Savoy from the mid-1940s and infrequent releases during the 1950s demonstrate Gordon's freewheeling energy and his bellowing foghorn tone-one of the most distinctive signature sounds in modern jazz-while later sessions for Blue Note present the mature statements of a major soloist.Few were listening, however, and Gordon moved overseas, where he spent most of the 1960s and 1970s."}

{"text": "His recordings from the early 1950s reveal a precocious player with formidable technique.But drug problems would sideline him until the late 1970s, and not until the mid-1980s would he enjoy the chance to record extensively and demonstrate the full scope of his abilities.Altoist Sonny Criss and pianist Hampton Hawes had played with Parker during his West Coast sojourn and developed into outstanding bop players in their own right, but both remained mostly local heroes, seldom gigging outside of California and gaining only grudging respect from the mostly East Coast-based critical establishment."}
{"text": "Capitol Records in Hollywood would enter the big leagues with its quasi-monopoly on sophisticated pop, as sung by Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Nat King Cole, Judy Garland, Dean Martin, Nancy Wilson, the Kingston Trio, and other name acts.But the jazz renaissance of the 1950s was promoted primarily by smaller outfits, entrepreneurial businesses built on the growing national reputations of the local jazz players.There is little glamour in the story of these companies- Max and Sol Weiss, for example, started off running a record pressing plant and only got into the music business to maintain the throughput of vinyl and shellac-but without the intervention of such entrepreneurs, West Coast jazz might never have experienced this halcyon era."}
{"text": "But the trumpeter persisted through it all-even the loss of his teeth in a drug-related beating could only halt his career temporarily-and his last years found him recording prolifically and still capable of moments of greatness.Baker's Tokyo concert captured on film less than twelve months before his death on May 13, 1988-from a mysterious fall from an Amsterdam hotel window-revealed that this musician had lost none of his melodic inventiveness.And, strange to say, the music in those final days captured a sweetness and architectonic order strikingly at odds with Baker's dissolute life."}
{"text": "But in the case of Pepper, his style eventually came to resemble his personality-honest, imploring, assertive, unapologetic.This marked a major change from the teenage altoist who had joined the Stan Kenton band in 1943, brandishing a soft, almost feminine tone, a relaxed improviser whose shimmering solos danced above the roaring brass of the band.His early work-'Art Pepper' with the Kenton band, 'Over the Rainbow' with Shorty Rogers-bespoke a nursery school innocence."}
{"text": "By the late 1950s, his playing had taken on a more probing quality, the sugary tone now offering a biting aftertaste.But during the 1960s, Pepper almost entirely disappeared from the scene.While in prison he came under the sway of John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman, and engaged in the musical equivalent of psychotherapy, dissecting and reassembling his style with these new influences grafted onto the old."}
{"text": "During his lengthy involvement with Synanon, a drug rehabilitation program, Pepper managed to integrate these new influences into an amazing whole, a predatory alto attack with a soft, vulnerable underbelly.The lyricism of his 1950s work was still evident, but his playing had become much freer, his tonal palette more varied, his creativity less fettered by the chord changes.A series of exceptional albums for the Galaxy and Contemporary labels documented this transformation and enabled Pepper to mount a major comeback after more than a decade of semi-obscurity."}
{"text": "Yet the passion of this music seemed at odds with the altoist's advanced years and failing health.Shortly before his death in 1982, Pepper published his autobiography, Straight Life, matching in prose the unflinching candor of his playing.For a time in the 1950s, a West Coast alto style was taking form, a more mellifluous alternative to the astringent Parker-inflected lines of the other coast."}

{"text": "On the surface, Desmond's solos appeared to offer a lush romanticism, but only careful listeners were apt to catch their richer implications.A single solo from the Dave Brubeck Quartet's twenty-fifth anniversary reunion tour finds Desmond celebrating these old acquaintances with a snippet of 'Auld Lang Syne'-followed by allusions to '52nd Street Theme,' 'The Gypsy,' 'Taps Miller,' 'Drum Boogie,' and 'Organ Grinder's Swing'-all in the context of a complex piece that shifts back and forth between 3/4 and 4/4.The next night, in a different town, Desmond no doubt initiated the process all over again, drawing on still other sources in his artfully constructed saxophone stream of consciousness."}
{"text": "His guest pairings with Chet Baker and Jim Hall, and his final quartet recordings with guitarist Ed Bickert, are neglected gems of the improvisational arts, jazz performances that bespeak a serene mastery as rare as it is affecting.By the start of the 1960s, this burst of creative work on the Coast was mostly completed.These were hard years for jazz in any locale-with the audience for improvised music at an all-time low-but several factors were especially damaging to West Coast jazz during this period."}
{"text": "Each musician's story was somewhat different, but the overall effect was devastating to the local jazz scene.Although some of these players would rebuild their careers in the 1970s and 1980s, the West Coast's relevance as a defining force in the jazz world had now virtually come to an end, the legacy of these glory years mostly forgotten in the midst of a new California youth culture with its surf music, fast cars, longer and longer hair, and shorter and shorter attention spans.In time, Miles Davis would come to personify the cool jazz movement of the 1950s."}

{"text": "French audiences, however, gave the music an enthusiastic response, and Davis luxuriated in the tolerant, hip attitude of the Parisians who gathered around the visiting jazz players.Kenny Clarke, the drummer with the band, decided to stay on in France, where he remained-enjoying a successful career working with small combos and a large band he co-led with Francy Boland, as well as writing for films-until his death in 1985.Miles also felt the attractions of the European environment and briefly considered a similar move."}
{"text": "Miles also felt the attractions of the European environment and briefly considered a similar move.Returning to New York in the summer of 1949, Davis fell into a deep depression.Moreover, the racial divisiveness of postwar America stood in stark contrast to the more open attitudes he had experienced in France."}
{"text": "Davis's recordings of this period provide only the barest hints of the dramatic evolution that would distinguish his post-1954 work.His 'Bluing' recording with Sonny Rollins from October 1951 anticipates the classic 'Walkin performance of 1954, but the lines are less formed, and the solo lacks the continuity of the latter piece.'Yesterdays' from May 1952 indicates Davis's potential as a balladeer, but his tone has yet to show the burnished patina of his mature work."}

{"text": "Around this same time, Capitol contributed to the trumpeter's reputation by rereleasing the earlier Nonet recordings on a long-playing album, titling them Birth of the Cool for the first time.But it was Davis's unexpected success at the 1955 Newport Jazz Festival that galvanized his following and spurred Columbia, the most powerful record company in the world, to sign the trumpeter to a contract.Davis had not been listed on the festival program, but he was added at the last minute to an all-star jam session."}
{"text": "Now, almost overnight, Davis had staked out a position as one of the most original ballad players in the history of jazz.One recalls, to cite a rare point of comparison, Ben Webster's triumphant struggle with the dominant Coleman Hawkins tenor model of the 1930s, which Webster finally distilled into his own personal approach.But doing so required a radical pruning and Webster's inspired shift away from Hawkins's voluptuousness toward a more oblique style."}
{"text": "None of these three players were well known at the time Davis hired them, but soon they would garner recognition as one of the finest rhythm sections of their day.In the summer of 1955, the new Davis band opened at Cafe Bohemia with tenorist Sonny Rollins joining Miles in the front line.Rollins's robust sax sound and linear style made him a perfect counterweight to Davis's more pointillistic approach."}
{"text": "Coltrane's elaborate solos conveyed a restless urgency.Hear him follow Miles's plaintive interpretation of Round Midnight,' on the quintet's celebrated 1956 recording, with a probing examination of the harmonic crevices in the music.This Davis group stayed together only a short while before a falling-out between the trumpeter and tenorist-aggravated by Coltrane's heroin addiction-sent the saxophonist packing to join the Thelonious Monk quartet."}
{"text": "The success of Miles Ahead inspired several follow-up projects.Davis and Evans's 1958 recording of compositions from Porgy and Bess came close to matching the high quality of the earlier work.A third project, Sketches of Spain, was recorded in late 1959 and early 1960 and features an exceptional adaptation of Joaquin Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez, originally written for guitar and orchestra, as well as a gripping Davis performance on 'Saeta.'"}

{"text": "In September, Coltrane had recorded his sole leader date for the Blue Note label, Blue Train, a top-flight effort distinguished by the tenorist's strong work on the title blues, and on 'Moment's Notice,' an intriguing exploration of shifting ii-V chords played at a fast clip.This piece-half composition, half harmonic exercise-anticipated the even more complex 'Giant Steps' of 1959.During this same period, Coltrane recorded extensively for the Prestige label, as both leader and sideman."}
{"text": "During this same period, Coltrane recorded extensively for the Prestige label, as both leader and sideman.This body of work tends to be obscured by the more adventurous material recorded by Coltrane for Atlantic and Impulse in the 1960s.Yet the Prestige recordings, despite the more conventional repertoire and 'blowing date' ambiance, successfully showcased Coltrane's skills as a mainstream jazz soloist in a variety of spirited settings, including memorable frontline battles with other name saxophonists."}
{"text": "All in all, the previous eighteen months had marked a major transformation for Coltrane.The man who rejoined the Davis band was a more mature soloist-and person-than the one who had left in the summer of 1957.The addition of John Coltrane, however, was only one of the steps Davis was taking to rebuild his band into what would prove to be the most celebrated working unit of his illustrious career."}

{"text": "In time, this unassuming figure would demand respect as the most influential jazz pianist of his generation, forging an innovative style that would permanently alter improvised keyboard music.But in 1958, few jazz fans had heard of this mild-mannered white pianist, whose major sideman credits were low-profile stints with Tony Scott and George Russell.True, Evans's lucid work on Russell's 'Concerto for Billy the Kid' and 'All About Rosie' had caught the attention of more discerning listeners."}
{"text": "True, Evans's lucid work on Russell's 'Concerto for Billy the Kid' and 'All About Rosie' had caught the attention of more discerning listeners.Yet his 1956 debut recording as a leader for the Riverside label sold only eight hundred copies in the twelve months following its release.Two years would elapse before Evans, now validated by his role in the Miles Davis band, would record again as a leader."}
{"text": "Two years would elapse before Evans, now validated by his role in the Miles Davis band, would record again as a leader.Born in Plainfield, New Jersey, on August 16, 1929, Evans began learning piano at age six and started his performing career at age twelve.He later studied music at Southeastern Louisiana University, focusing on piano, flute, and music theory."}
{"text": "Evans had already left the band by the time these pieces were recorded, after only eight months with Davis.' I felt exhausted in every way-physically, mentally and spiritually,' he later recalled . In September 1959, Cannonball Adderley departed as well, despite Davis's guaranteeing a minimum annual salary of $20,000, which was more than the altoist could hope to earn leading his own band.After reluctantly joining Davis for a European tour in early 1960, John Coltrane also left the fold."}

{"text": "These were devastating losses.Davis would eventually regroup with a superb mid-1960s band, but in the interim he struggled to recruit suitable replacements for these unique talents.On saxophone, for example, the early 1960s found Davis using, for greater or shorter periods, Jimmy Heath, Sonny Stitt, Hank Mobley, Frank Strozier, George Coleman, Sam Rivers, and others."}

{"text": "The trio's follow-up recording-which would also prove to be its last-finds these hints of greatness coalescing into a full-fledged mastery.On June 25, 1961, Evans's record company taped the trio's performance at New York's Village Vanguard.The two dozen selections recorded that day achieve a telepathic level of group interplay, one in which the line between soloist and accompanist- isolated and distinct in the swing and bop idioms-often blurs and at times totally disappears."}
{"text": "Like Davis and Coltrane, Evans struggled with drug addiction.During the 1960s, his heroin habit punished him physically and financially.Yet Evans's music seemed to reflect a different reality, often suggesting a contemplative otherworldliness above the fray of day-to-day concerns."}
{"text": "Yet Evans's music seemed to reflect a different reality, often suggesting a contemplative otherworldliness above the fray of day-to-day concerns.During the 1970s, Evans was free for a time from drugs, and his music making took on a smoother sheen, less introspective and more assertive, especially in the pianist's work alongside the accomplished bassist Eddie Gomez.Even more aggressive-at times almost angry-was the music made by his final trio, which featured bassist Marc Johnson and drummer Joe La Barbera."}
{"text": "A bleeding ulcer was the final, official cause of a cumulative process of self- destruction.At the time of his death, on September 15, 1980, Evans was fifty-one years old.How influential was Bill Evans?"}
{"text": "A host of later Davis sidemen also showed Evans's influence, especially Herbie Hancock and Chick Corea.Less well known are Denny Zeitlin's stunning 1960s trio recordings for Columbia, produced by John Hammond, that served as especially powerful examples of how Evans's probing style and concept of trio interaction could serve as the basis for the next generation of jazz pianists.Zeitlin's music displayed a rare skill in mixing quasi-avant-garde techniques with sublime lyricism, as demonstrated on such projects as Cathexis, Live at the Trident, and Zeitgeist."}
{"text": "By the following year, Coltrane's fascination with complex chord progressions was tempered by a renewed interest in pieces with a modal flavor.On his June 1960 recording with Don Cherry, backed by Ornette Coleman's rhythm section, Coltrane makes frequent use of modal techniques.'My Favorite Things,' recorded a few months later, finds him alternating between conventional chord progressions and simple vamps suitable for modal improvisation."}
{"text": "These three players would mature in tandem over the next several years, feeding off each other's energy, pushing each other deeper and deeper into the music.A member of a prominent jazz family, Elvin Jones was less well known than his siblings Hank and Thad at the time he moved to New York in 1956.But, by the close of his tenure with Coltrane, Elvin Jones had established himself as one of most influential drummers in the history of jazz."}
{"text": "That year Tyner's career received a boost when he was asked to join the Benny Golson/Art Farmer Jazztet.Less than a year later, Tyner left to become a member of the Coltrane quartet, where he would stay until 1965.Blessed with a crisp, clean piano attack and a knack for constructing elaborate improvised lines, Tyner could have been a premier hard-bop pianist."}
{"text": "His touch at the piano, which originally possessed brittle sharpness, took on volume and depth, eventually emerging as one of the fullest and most easily identifiable keyboard sounds in jazz.Tyner's career continued to flourish long after he left Coltrane, and his work in subsequent decades, especially his 1970s albums for the Milestone label-including vital projects such as Echoes of a Friend, Atlantis, Trident, Supertrios, and Fly with the Wind-would exert a noticeable influence on the jazz pianists of that era.But though others mimicked Tyner's mannerisms, voicings, and modal runs, these acolytes seldom approached the intensity of the original."}
{"text": "But though others mimicked Tyner's mannerisms, voicings, and modal runs, these acolytes seldom approached the intensity of the original.In 1961, Coltrane was among the first musicians to sign with the new Impulse record label.A sizable advance made Coltrane the second highest paid musician in jazz, an honor in which he trailed only his former employer Miles Davis."}
{"text": "Most of the intervening years were consumed by private study, supplemented by occasional low-profile gigs in the LA area.By the close of the 1950s, Dolphy had developed into a virtuoso saxophonist, in many ways the most fitting heir among his generation to the Parker mantle, not due to any slavish imitation of the master-that Dolphy emphatically did not do-but through his insistence on following the implications of Bird to the logical next level.Like Parker, his music was played with urgency, at times explosiveness, daring to linger at the tenuous juncture where the human cry and musical scale meet."}
{"text": "And, in time, Dolphy would push his music to an even more pronounced modernism than Parker's, ultimately breaching the conventional limits of tonality and structure.After moving to New York in 1959, Dolphy soon found himself in the midst of a vortex of radical changes sweeping the jazz landscape.He would only live another five years, but for Dolphy this would be a teeming half-decade of musical achievements."}
{"text": "But his work as a leader has also left a large mark on the jazz world.His studio projects produced a number of estimable efforts, including Far Cry for Prestige and Out to Lunch for Blue Note, as well as a compelling set of live performances recorded with the brilliant young trumpeter Booker Little at the Five Spot on July 16, 1961.Yet the ensemble rises far above these constraints, pushing each number to its limits, and maintaining a fierce energy on pieces such as 'The Prophet,' 'Aggression,' and 'Fire Waltz.'"}
{"text": "Certainly it is tempting to speculate how Dolphy and Little might have evolved had their partnership lasted another five or ten years.In the late 1950s, however, the chief challenge to Coltrane's preeminence as the leading saxophonist of his day came not from Coleman or Ayler-little known at the time-or even from Dolphy.The most persuasive alternative to his 'sheets of sound' approach emanated, rather, from the heart of the jazz tradition, in the person of tenorist Sonny Rollins."}
{"text": "One could hear the connections that tied him to the legacy of a Coleman Hawkins or a Don Byas and other vintage horn players, seamlessly blended with hypermodern elements drawn from the current scene.' I like to think there is a direct link between early jazz and jazz of any time,' Rollins told interviewer Bob Blumenthal in 1982.' I like to think that jazz can be played in a way that you can hear the old as well as the new."}
{"text": "Schuller's observation may have made the spontaneous flow of Rollins's creativity sound like the result of a pseudo-mathematical process.Is there a better example of thematic development than King Oliver's solo on 'Dipper Mouth Blues' from 1923?)Still, much truth lay at the heart of these observations."}
{"text": "Perhaps no jazz musician has ever had a more intense upbringing in the heart of the jazz world than Sonny Rollins.Born in New York on September 9, 1930, Rollins was always surrounded by world-class players.While still in his teens, and after only two years playing the sax, he spent idle hours rehearsing with Thelonious Monk."}
{"text": "Johnson, and many other stars of the postwar jazz scene.In the mid-1950s, he was a member of the Clifford Brown-Max Roach Quintet, a unit that ranks, by any measure, among the most important working bands of the decade.By the time Rollins began releasing his many classic recordings as a leader in the late 1950s, he could boast a curriculum vitae unsurpassed by any of his contemporaries in the jazz world."}

{"text": "Yet they apparently had the opposite effect, leaving a permanent undercurrent of self-criticism and dissatisfaction below Rollins's calm exterior.Fans have grown familiar with this attitude-few were surprised when Rollins decided not to release the recording of his celebrated 2007 Carnegie Hall concert, which, despite rave reviews, did not live up to his own expectations.This was simply the tenorist's standard modus operandi, as demonstrated over the course of a career clouded by retracings, temporary retirements, and disappearances from the scene for practice and self-assessment."}
{"text": "Similarly, the advent of Ornette Coleman and free jazz helped to spur another period of introspection.However, Rollins's most famous sabbatical from the jazz scene, which lasted from August 1959 to November 1961, has taken on mythic proportions in the artist's biography.This period often found the famous jazz star strolling up and down the Williamsburg Bridge on many evenings, playing his horn for the astonished passersby."}
{"text": "A series of tenacious trio and quartet recordings were at the core of his oeuvre.Among the quartet projects, Worktime from December 1955 stands out as a major statement, perhaps Rollins's finest to that point in his career.This was followed by the even more lauded Saxophone Colossus from June 1956, and The Sound of Sonny, with pianist Sonny Clark, made one year later."}

{"text": "The main change here was the addition of guitarist Jim Hall, a subtle accompanist and inspired soloist, but hardly the 'new thing' in jazz.Post-1960, Rollins's career tended to display tentative forays into the latest trend, followed inevitably by a return to more familiar ground.For a time, Rollins hired some musicians associated with Ornette Coleman, but never made the full plunge into 'freedom' music."}
{"text": "Later recordings found him flirting with jazz-rock fusion but never assimilating it fully either.When interest in acoustic jazz increased in the 1970s, Rollins obliged by joining McCoy Tyner, Ron Carter, and Al Foster for a much-publicized concert tour and recording.But this, too, proved to be a passing phase."}
{"text": "But this, too, proved to be a passing phase.In general, latter-day Rollins's finest moments came in mainstream settings of this sort, where he was challenged by formidable peers-a duet with Tyner, a sax battle with Branford Marsalis, a recording with Tommy Flanagan and Jack DeJohnette-or playing without a band, as on The Solo Album from 1985, rather than fronting his often merely adequate working combo.Rollins's various retirements, reclusions, and reconsiderations could stand as symbolic of the whole era."}
{"text": "Instead jazz, it seemed, was condemned to-or was it blessed by? -a pluralism, in which 'next new things' would come and go with amazing alacrity.In the fall of 1953, Max Roach moved to California to replace Shelly Manne as drummer with the Lighthouse All-Stars.This sideman stint lasted only a few months before promoter Gene Norman approached Roach about leading his own band at the California Club."}

{"text": "Brown had made his first recordings, as a member of a rhythm-and-blues band, only two years before, but was already being heralded by jazz insiders as a major talent.Born in Wilmington, Delaware, on October 30, 1930, Brown had played the bugle as a youngster, and began trumpet lessons at age twelve.For a time, Brown attended Delaware State College as a math major, but by his late teens had decided on a career in jazz."}

{"text": "Over the next decade, this style would gradually gain acceptance as the dominant mainstream sound of modern jazz.Even before leaving California, the Brown-Roach Quintet gave notice of its evolving approach to combo playing through a series of recordings made in Hollywood in early August 1954.Two Brown compositions destined to become jazz standards, 'Joy Spring' and 'Daahoud,' were given definitive performances, graced by exceptional trumpet solos, as was Duke Jordan's 'Jordu.'"}
{"text": "'The Blues Walk,' from the same period, showcased the more assertive side of the combo in a fiery performance climaxed by a dazzling series of 'chase' choruses that pitted Brown and saxophonist Harold Land against one another.Soon after this recording, Land was replaced by the young Sonny Rollins, who was featured prominently on the band's 1956 recordings at Basin Street in New York.The Brown-Roach Quintet would last little more than two years."}

{"text": "Blakey would later serve as a sideman on a number of important modern jazz recording sessions, including many of Thelonious Monk's finest early efforts.In the late 1940s, Blakey also led a large band and a smaller combo under the name Jazz Messengers.In the mid-1950s, he revived the name with a co-op quintet that featured pianist Horace Silver and a front line of trumpeter Kenny Dorham and tenor saxophonist Hank Mobley."}

{"text": "Blakey's early efforts with Silver kept faithful to the bebop model.But in early 1955, the Messengers embarked on a new direction with their recording of 'The Preacher,' a funky blues piece infused with elements of gospel music.This recording was immensely popular and widely imitated by later hard-bop bands."}
{"text": "After separating from Silver, Blakey explored a wide range of possibilities.In 1957 alone, Blakey led sessions for eight different record labels.Around this time he renewed his musical relationship with Thelonious Monk; put together a percussion ensemble; led a fifteen-piece big band; spearheaded small combos that featured, among others, Jackie McLean, Johnny Griffin, and Donald Byrd; and, with the Messengers, even gave the movement a flagship album with his Hard Bop release."}
{"text": "But in time Blakey realized that his greatest successes came through nurturing the talents around him, as composers as well as players.The band's 1958 Blue Note release Moanin' mesmerized listeners with pianist Bobby Timmons's title track-which evoked church music and early African American call-and-response refrains-as well as with 'Blues March' and 'Along Came Betty' by Messenger saxophonist Benny Golson.Moanin' remains one of the defining statements of the hard-bop idiom, largely because of Blakey's willingness to led his sidemen take the lead in crafting the music."}
{"text": "Originally under the sway of Clifford Brown, Morgan came to develop a more personal style that mixed pungent short phrases with swinging longer lines and repeated figures.After leaving Blakey in 1961, Morgan recorded extensively as a leader for the Blue Note label and achieved a major success with his 1963 staccato funk outing 'The Sidewinder,' which eventually reached number twenty-five on the Billboard chart.Morgan spent much of the rest of his career trying to recreate this winning formula, although he was also capable of probing, less jukebox-friendly artistic statements, such as Search for the New Land, an exquisite release recorded only a few weeks after 'The Sidewinder.'"}

{"text": "After Golson's departure, Blakey hired tenorist Hank Mobley for a spell, recording a stirring nightclub performance under the title At the Jazz Corner of the World during this period.The addition of saxophonist Wayne Shorter later in the year initiated a new expansion in the scope of the band, which was solidified by the arrival of trumpeter Freddie Hubbard and pianist Cedar Walton in 1961.Shorter's elliptical manner of improvising and composing would come to exert a decisive influence on the Messengers, signaling a break with the rhythm-and-blues orientation of the Morgan-Timmons-Golson unit."}

{"text": "And no jazz trumpeter of the day seemed to have a brighter future.Yet by the early 1980s, Shaw's prominence was abruptly eclipsed by the arrival of Wynton Marsalis, who not only was quickly tagged as the new young lion of the trumpet, but also succeeded Shaw as the major focus of jazz promotion efforts at CBS Records.A career that looked as though it would take off through the stratosphere now faltered, and finally came crashing down when Shaw lost his arm in a mysterious 1988 fall in the path of a New York subway train."}

{"text": "Around this same time, Wild Bill Davis established an organ trio that would also prove influential.But it was not until the arrival of Jimmy Smith on the jazz scene in the mid-1950s that the Hammond organ achieved wide recognition as a legitimate jazz instrument.In time, a legion of other keyboardists followed Smith's example and, by the close of the decade, the Hammond organ was firmly established as a mainstay of soul jazz."}

{"text": "Even in the new millennium, the organ is the most popular jazz keyboard outside of the piano, attracting a cadre of dedicated fans and world-class exponents.The glory days of the Hammond B-3 were all but over by the time Joey DeFrancesco was born, in 1971, but he has completely assimilated the tradition of Jimmy Smith and other predecessors, and has introduced new generations of fans to its persuasive sounds via relentless touring, amounting to around two hundred nights on the road in any given year, and more than two dozen recordings as a leader.DeFrancesco has done more than anyone to keep the organ in a prominent position in the jazz world during the new millennium, but he is far from a lone evangelist."}
{"text": "This too would quickly become a hackneyed sound, although major players such as Kenny Burrell and Grant Green proved capable of important recordings that transcended the form's limitations.Burrell's 1963 Midnight Blue is a classic hard-bop release, while his Guitar Forms project with Gil Evans, from the following year, less easy to categorize, is a major milestone by almost any measure.Grant Green's Matador, recorded in 1964 but not released for fifteen years, finds the bandleader in the inspirational company of Elvin Jones and McCoy Tyner, then anchoring John Coltrane's rhythm section, while Green's collaborations with pianist Sonny Clark from the early 1960s represent one of the most inspired pairings of piano and guitar in the hard-bop ouevre."}

{"text": "His recordings cover a wide gamut-from straight-ahead to soul jazz to mood music-but his singular talent gave even the most blatantly commercial efforts a stamp of artistry.Born in Indianapolis in 1923, Wes was a member of a musical family that also included bassist Monk Montgomery and pianist/vibraphonist Buddy Montgomery.Despite a late start-he did not begin playing the guitar until he was almost twenty years old-and a lack of formal training, Wes quickly developed into a distinctive stylist and a quirky but exquisite improviser."}
{"text": "Within months, Wes was working on gigs with his brothers and other local musicians.A reluctant traveler, Montgomery went on the road with Lionel Hampton in the late 1940s, but returned to Indianapolis in 1950 where he raised a family, worked by day in a radio factory, and performed at night.Montgomery's career might well have ended in obscurity in this setting."}
{"text": "Montgomery's career might well have ended in obscurity in this setting.However, an enthusiastic recommendation by Cannonball Adderley led to the Riverside label's signing Montgomery in 1959.Under the direction of producer Orrin Keepnews, Montgomery recorded extensively over the next several years in jazz combo settings with top-quality sidemen, creating a number of milestone performances, including 'Four on Six,' 'West Coast Blues,' and 'Besame Mucho.'"}
{"text": "By the time of his final projects with the A & Mlabel, Montgomery was relegated to playing cover versions of Beatles songs and other pop/rock tunes.But even these recordings were not without their moments, and they had at least the benefit of broadening Montgomery's audience- indeed, Montgomery's A Day in the Life release became the biggest-selling jazz record of 1967.The guitarist did not live long enough to enjoy the full benefits of this success."}
{"text": "The following year he succumbed to a heart attack at age forty-five.As Montgomery's late-career switch to a more pop/rock-oriented format should make clear, the soul jazz idiom was showing its age by the late 1960s.For many years, the soul jazz players had managed to maintain a solid following among the black working class."}
{"text": "The Motown sound, jazz-rock fusion, and other related idioms reflected a slicker, more contemporary facet of African American music.The 1970s saw the completion of this trend, with the urban market for soul jazz almost completely displaced by funk, disco, reggae, soul, and rock.Jazz devotees sometimes groused that this shift reflected a watering down of standards in black popular music."}
{"text": "'21 The ideological distance between these two critics can be gauged by the fact that Collier follows his denunciation of hard bop by praising the superiority of the Dixieland revival, while Jones's critique is in the context of a paean to free jazz.The fact that they could agree on the degraded state of hard bop, post-1960, is revealing.There may have been debates about the line of succession, but many concurred that the old king was dead."}
{"text": "Yet both critics go too far.As we have seen, Blakey and Silver-the two main protagonists in the birth of hard bop-led some of their finest bands during the 1960s.Most listeners would have had trouble linking these projects to the traditional Blakey-Silver approach, but other, less radical Blue Note releases showed that there could be a meeting point between hard bop and the avant-garde."}
{"text": "A host of other Blue Note projects by Herbie Hancock, Joe Henderson, Lee Morgan, Wayne Shorter, Sam Rivers, and others also made it clear that this idiom was far from exhausted.Anyone who doubted that hard-bop stylings could adapt and evolve during the 1960s need merely listen to pianist Andrew Hill's 1960s recordings for Blue Note.Few fans did so at the time-and it is testimony to the label's commitment to this artist that Blue Note continued to release new music by the pianist throughout the decade despite his poor sales."}
{"text": "Few fans did so at the time-and it is testimony to the label's commitment to this artist that Blue Note continued to release new music by the pianist throughout the decade despite his poor sales.Hill, born in Chicago in 1931, drew on a wide range of influences at an early stage in his development, studying with mentors as diverse as Bill Russo and Paul Hindemith, and gigging with beboppers and rhythm-and-blues bands.Hill's mature work was a strange amalgamation, prickly and cerebral by turns, and not targeted at crossover airplay like so many other Blue Note releases from the period."}
{"text": "At the time, his music was too 'inside' to be embraced by the avant-garde, but too 'difficult' to appeal to most soul jazz and hard-bop fans.At the time of Hill's death in 2007, one could hear echoes of his work in leading younger-generation artists such as Jason Moran, Vijay Iyer, and Matthew Shipp.Two preeminent jazz bandleaders of the era-Charles Mingus and Miles Davis- also drew inspiration from the hard-bop style, albeit transforming it in the process."}
{"text": "Whether playing a down-home blues, a silky ballad, an abstract tone poem, a New Orleans two-step, or a freewheeling jam, his work was immediately identifiable, bearing the unique imprimatur of Charles Mingus.A few months after his birth in Nogales, Arizona, on April 22, 1922, Charles Mingus lost his mother, Harriet, to myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart.The child was raised mostly in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles by a prim and devout stepmother who advocated spiritual flagellation, and an abusive father, Sergeant Charles Mingus Sr, who simply handed out earthly whippings."}

{"text": "Indeed, the cool style, for a time, seemed like it might become a decisive influence.The bassist's 1954 Jazzical Moods, for example, reveals a cerebral and restrained Mingus very much at odds with the hot-blooded extrovert of a few years later.It was not until the late 1950s that these different allegiances began to be subsumed into a more distinct, personal style."}

{"text": "Not all of Mingus's efforts from this period held together so well.His 1962 Town Hall Concert is most often remembered as one of the great fiascos in the history of jazz.Scores were still uncompleted at curtain time, with two copyists continuing to work after the curtain was raised."}
{"text": "Psychological troubles plagued him throughout his career.In 1958, Mingus even tried to refer himself to the Bellevue mental hospital.In naive fashion, he had knocked on the door."}
{"text": "This was the same man who enlisted his analyst to write liner notes and who named a song 'All the Things You Could Be by Now if Sigmund Freud's Wife Was Your Mother.'The 1960s were tumultuous years for the bassist.Before the Town Hall concert, Mingus's temper exploded during a meeting with trombonist Jimmy Knepper, who was working as a copyist."}
{"text": "Mingus punched Knepper, who eventually took him to court on assault charges.The most memorable moment from the documentary Mingus, filmed in 1966, was not of music making, but of the movie's subject being evicted from his apartment for nonpayment of rent.When the Mingus at Monterey recording was released a short while later, it included a personal note from the bassist, soliciting donations to compensate for 'the misfortunes I have suffered.'"}
{"text": "But such was the instability in Mingus's life that, by the time the record hit the stores, he could no longer be reached at the post office box listed in the liner notes.By the close of the 1960s, Mingus was barely visible in the jazz world, performing rarely, recording not at all.It comes as little surprise that Mingus had such trouble summing up his chaotic life in a proposed autobiography."}
{"text": "When a publisher contracted him to write his life story, Mingus intimated that he was putting together a fifteen-hundred-page manuscript.When Beneath the Underdog finally appeared in 1971, it was only a fraction of that length.And those looking for a point-by-point exposition of Mingus's career as a musician were likely to be disappointed by the text."}
{"text": "On the heels of this literary effort, Mingus saw his musical career rejuvenated.He signed with Columbia, and-in a telling irony-recorded 'The Chill of Death,' a piece that same label had shelved back in 1947.Mingus's 1970s band with saxophonist George Adams and pianist Don Pullen, joined by longtime Mingus drummer Dannie Richmond, was a powerful unit that could hold up under the inevitable comparisons with earlier Jazz Workshop ensembles."}

{"text": "Mingus's compositional skills continued to shine in diverse works, ranging from the constantly shifting 'Sue's Changes' to the unabashedly traditional swing ballad 'Duke Ellington's Sound of Love.'Three or Four Shades of Blue from 1977 found Mingus joined by electric guitar and leaning, ever so coyly, in the direction of jazz-rock fusion.Mingus was reportedly upset at the label for pushing his music in a commercial direction but softened his criticism after the release turned out to be the biggest seller of his career."}
{"text": "When in public, he could be seen using a cane.Toward the end of 1977, the doctors diagnosed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-known more commonly as Lou Gehrig's disease-a humbling disorder marked by a gradual loss of coordination and mastery over one's body.Mingus continued to compose, singing into a tape recorder when he no longer had control over his fingers."}
{"text": "He initiated projects, including one with pop diva Joni Mitchell, that he did not live long enough to see through to completion.His last days were spent pursuing alternative medical therapies in Mexico, where he died in Cuernavaca on January 5, 1979.His music continued to flourish posthumously."}
{"text": "A tribute band featuring former sidemen performed under the name Mingus Dynasty, while a similar continuation of the bassist's influence was seen in a combo led by George Adams and Don Pullen.And over a decade after his passing, Mingus's unwieldy two-hour long Epitaph-drawn from the music of the 1962 Town Hall concert described above- was pieced together by Gunther Schuller and performed and recorded to much fanfare.In these transition years for jazz, only Miles Davis challenged Mingus in continually redefining the modern jazz-combo vocabulary while still keeping a distance- often only a small distance-from the more extreme implications of free jazz."}
{"text": "Behind all this lay Davis's foresight in selecting the three rhythm players, each of them relative newcomers to the New York scene at the time they joined his band.Herbie Hancock had spent his formative years in Chicago, where he was born in 1940.During his teens he served as a sideman with visiting jazz stars and performed with his own groups."}
{"text": "During his teens he served as a sideman with visiting jazz stars and performed with his own groups.After graduating from Grinnell College in 1960, Hancock came to New York as a member of trumpeter Donald Byrd's band.In May 1962, just twelve months before joining Davis, Hancock made his first album as a leader, Takin' Off for the Blue Note label."}

{"text": "Perceiving that racial prejudice would make it difficult to pursue a symphonic career, Carter switched his emphasis to the double bass, but even then continued to study and perform the classical repertoire.After completing studies at the Eastman School in 1959, Carter worked with Chico Hamilton, Thelonious Monk, and Cannonball Adderley, and recorded with Eric Dolphy, Jaki Byard, Randy Weston, and Don Ellis, among others.These engagements paved the way to Carter's five-year stint with Davis beginning in 1963."}

{"text": "These two recent arrivals on the New York scene were, however, seasoned professionals in comparison with Davis's choice for drummer.Tony Williams was only seventeen years old when he joined Davis in May 1963-just a few months after having moved to New York at Jackie McLean's behest.Williams was so young that Davis faced problems with authorities when he was booked to play in nightclubs where minors were not allowed."}
{"text": "True, at appropriate moments, Williams could and would kick the Davis combo into a steady groove, but these outbursts were especially effective because they came in the context of the more open and unfettered sound typically favored by the quintet.On the surface, it appeared as if Davis's mid-1960s band led two separate lives.The studio recordings revealed a pioneering unit performing quasi-abstract original compositions, whose musical iconoclasm bordered on the avant-garde."}
{"text": "Any lingering sentimentality was being squeezed out of these pieces, the tempos were getting faster and faster, and the band's interpretations more daring and unpredictable.We are fortunate that this combo was so well documented in performance-its recorded legacy includes memorable concerts in Europe and Japan, and more than seven hours of ardent music making captured at Chicago's Plugged Nickel in December 1965.In total, this body of work encompasses some of the most vital reworkings of the jazz standard repertoire from any era."}
{"text": "His own music was now evolving in response to these new influences.The big break with the past would come with his seminal Bitches Brew release of 1969, but even before that seismic shift, the signs of this coming change could be seen in his growing use of electric instruments and vamp forms.During this same period, Hancock began using an electric piano on some tracks."}
{"text": "During this same period, Hancock began using an electric piano on some tracks.By the time of Filles de Kilimanjaro, recorded during June and September 1968, the multilayered textures of the earlier quintet releases were increasingly replaced by more insistent ground rhythms.With In a Silent Way from the following February, the change was all but complete."}
{"text": "To cement this change, Davis was enlisting the skills of a wider range of musicians, including keyboardists Joe Zawinul and Chick Corea, guitarist John McLaughlin, and bassist Dave Holland.Within a few months, the last fading elements of the mid-1960s band were purged in favor of the more overtly rock-oriented approach celebrated in Bitches Brew.This release, lamented by many of Davis's older fans, would attract a younger audience to his music and earn the trumpeter the first gold record of his career."}
{"text": "Instead, there was merely an exemplary splintering, a disintegration into isolated modules.Even back in the 1970s, the jazz world understood that technology would change the music.Yet most performers, if pushed for particulars at that time, would have talked about the spread of synthesizers and keyboards, advances in electric guitars, and the impact of various other plugged-in devices on the bandstand."}
{"text": "If one measures the success of the jazz scene by the quantity of product out there, then we are living in the Golden Age.More jazz recordings are released in a single month now than came out in an entire year back in the 1950s.The irony is that this profusion of compact discs is happening at the very time that the CD is no longer necessary and is under attack from nimbler virtual ways of distributing music."}
{"text": "Back in the States, trumpeter Dave Douglas performs in a jazz club, and a few hours later is selling downloads of the music on his website.Crossborder jams are harder, given the time lag in sound traveling long distances, yet in 2007 Dave Brubeck pulled off a 'live' performance with the BBC Orchestra during which the pianist was in a studio in Rockefeller Plaza in New York, while the orchestra and conductor were facing the audience in London.Of course, you don't need to be a star to jam over the web these days, and if you aren't ready for the competition, online music lessons are easily available on numerous sites-get some tips from an established pro in New York or Hollywood, without leaving your apartment in Budapest or Bangalore."}
{"text": "New types of organization are also emerging to empower artists and create support networks in this changed environment.The ArtistShare company, founded by Brian Camelio in 2001, allows musicians to tap their own audience base to fund creative projects.Fans who make contributions get special perks, which might even include an invitation to the recording session or having their name printed in the liner notes to the resulting compact disc."}
{"text": "Perhaps the increasingly unstable financial situation of the jazz world explains the greater tone of seriousness that seems to have entered the music in the new millennium.The ironic attitudes that had been so common among the first wave of postmodern players in the 1980s and 1990s have lessened; the playful mixing and matching of genres still takes place but far less often; and above all a new earnestness permeates the scene.Several factors have no doubt contributed to this state of affairs."}
{"text": "After 9/11, a number of pundits proclaimed the 'death of irony,' and the economic malaise of the decade did little to lighten the cultural tone, which even outside of the music industry is increasingly brusque and down-to-earth.But one suspects that a change in attitude in the jazz world would have emerged under any circumstances, just as we have witnessed similar shifts from playful to serious approaches in earlier decades-for example, with the rise of bebop in the mid-1940s and the emergence of the avant-garde fifteen years later.No artist reflects this earnest attitude more decidedly than pianist Brad Mehldau."}
{"text": "By the time Mehldau has refracted these compositions through his own house of musical mirrors, these former hit tunes have been turned into jazz art songs and bear the full weight of the pianist's exploratory tendencies.The song he is playing might be '50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,' but when Mehldau's trio performs it in 7/4 meter with dauntingly dense instrumental textures, you will be forgiven for not recognizing Paul Simon's number one hit from 1975.Born in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1970, Mehldau spent much of his youth in Connecticut and moved to New York in 1988 to study at the New School under Fred Hersch."}

{"text": "'The constant comparison of this trio with the Bill Evans trio by critics has been a thorn in my side.I remember listening to his music only a little, when I was 13 or 14 years old, for several months.Often what I am doing in my solo is basing its melodic content on the initial melody of the song."}
{"text": "In this regard, he is less an extension of Cecil Taylor and perhaps more aligned with the attitudes of predecessors such as Thelonious Monk, Sun Ra, Horace Tapscott, and Andrew Hill, who preferred to grapple at the boundaries of tonal systems rather than completely abandon their centrifugal hold on the music.Shipp was born in Wilmington, Delaware, in 1960, and though jazz was heard frequently at his home-his mother had known that other great Wilmington musician, Clifford Brown-he also played in rock bands during high school and listened to artists such as Stevie Wonder and Earth, Wind & Fire.This wide mix of early influences has been occasionally reflected in Shipp's own eclectic approach to bandleading, which has found him sometimes drawing on hip-hop elements, synthesized sounds, loops, and other electronic effects, but also achieving equal success in all-acoustic settings."}
{"text": "These three singers each operate at a subtle, microtonal level, creating hushed emotional effects through nuances of phrasing and a psychologically attuned performance style that is a world apart from the extroverted stylings of the past.Diana Krall, born in British Columbia in 1964, is an adroit pianist as well as a star singer, and her early recordings often reminded listeners of another singing pianist, Nat King Cole.As her work evolved, Krall found her sweet spot in moody ballads and gentle bossa novas, and though she drew her repertoire from the most familiar standards, songs that jazz fans have heard countless times, this artist made them feel as raw as a fresh wound."}
{"text": "Her talent made her a celebrated jazz diva-and her marriage to Elvis Costello boosted her fame further to a paparazzi level of notoriety-yet Krall's popularity is less due to these trappings of grandeur than to a confessional tone to her music that, if anything, lessens the distance between the vocalist and her listeners.Even Krall's impressive record sales have failed to match the spectacular levels achieved by Norah Jones, whose 2002 debut album Come Away with Me sold a staggering twenty-five million copies.For a time, the fan fever for this music, and especially for the hit single 'Don't Know Why,' ran so high that her album accounted for more than half of the jazz compact discs sold in many retail outlets."}
{"text": "With Jones it is tempting to link this skill to her father, Ravi Shankar, who was a master of the same types of effects on the sitar.But Jones, who was born in Brooklyn in 1979 and raised in Texas, also incorporates a gentle country twang to her singing, and includes Willie Nelson, alongside Billie Holiday and Bill Evans, when listing mentors and influences.Jones's greatest impact, however, may be less in the specifics of her interpretations than in her blending of the jazz vocal tradition with the ethos of the singer-songwriter, especially its emphasis on promoting new material and tone of intimate self-expression."}
{"text": "Eva Cassidy's situation is quite similar to Jones's, both in her mastery of chiaroscuro shades of phrasing and in the jazz establishment's reluctance to embrace her as one of its own.Fans have been unequivocal, however, in their advocacy of this singer, who tragically died from melanoma in 1996 at the age of thirty-three.She was little known during her lifetime, and her posthumous rise to fame ranks as one of the most unexpected and gratifying grassroots movements that the music world has witnessed in recent times."}
{"text": "McFerrin has surprised and at times irritated listeners-yet no doubt delighting others-with the unpredictable zigzags his career has taken.He achieved tremendous success with his 1988 reggae-inflected hit 'Don't Worry, Be Happy,' although one suspects that few of the radio listeners who pushed it up the charts realized that it was one facet of an ambitious project in which all of the parts were overdubs of McFerrin's voice.McFerrin evinced little interest in capitalizing on his growing renown after this crossover hit, choosing to take a sabbatical just at the moment when he could have packed concert halls and conquered the airwaves with follow-up tunes."}
{"text": "Philadelphia-born Wallace Roney is a contemporary of Marsalis's, but he is perhaps best known as an heir to the legacy of Miles Davis.Yet Roney's close affiliation with Miles- capped by his stepping in to play Davis's own parts side-by-side with the master at a historic concert at the 1991 Montreux Jazz Festival shortly before Davis's death-testifies to his close affiliation with this earlier body of work.As we will see in our look at European jazz scene, a number of trumpeters across that continent have found inspiration in the stylings of cool school icon Chet Baker, and there is similarly no shortage of younger players following in the fingerings of Freddie Hubbard, Don Cherry, Dizzy Gillespie, and other past masters of the jazz idiom."}
{"text": "If jazz is becoming a museum, the trumpeters have proven to be the most fervent curators.This return to the roots was controversial in the 1990s but is less so in the new millennium.In fact, the most striking fact about the jazz scene of post-2000 is the gradual lessening of tension between the combative camps that have long dominated the art form."}

{"text": "This contentiousness didn't disappear overnight when the calendar turned to a new century, but the overall trend has been unmistakable.Back in 1960, sociologist Daniel Bell stirred controversy by announcing the 'end of ideology' in a famous essay-a prediction that proved to be premature, to say the least.Yet jazz musicians are now showing sociopolitical thinkers what this freedom from cant actually looks like."}
{"text": "Much the same could be said about Roy Hargrove, another leading trumpeter, who is equally at home leading a big band, fronting an Afro-Cuban ensemble, accompanying singers, working with his hip-hop collective, the RH Factor, or playing the old standards in a small-combo setting.Hargrove was born in Waco, Texas, in 1969, and while still in high school benefited from the mentoring of Wynton Marsalis-who has emerged as a guiding light for many younger players and may eventually prove to be the leading talent scout of his era in addition to everything he has done as a performer-composer.In the early days of Hargrove's career, critics might have been tempted to pigeonhole him as another young traditionalist."}
{"text": "His fan base has grown because of how his music sounds, not because of what it signifies.Tenor saxophonist Joshua Redman, born in Berkeley in 1969, has followed a far different route to get to a similar end point, growing up on the West Coast, thriving in academics-he was valedictorian of his high school class and attended Harvard University, where he graduated summa cum laude-and toying with the idea of becoming a doctor or lawyer before settling on the sax.But like Lovano, Redman stands out as a unifying figure, drawing on many camps without giving full allegiance to any one of them."}
{"text": "His father, Dewey Redman-who had come of age with Ornette Coleman and later played in Keith Jarrett's so-called American quartet- was demonstrating a similar flexibility back when the jazz world was far more polarized; but Redman the younger has been, if anything, even more peripatetic in his music making.He dazzled listeners at the 1991 Thelonious Monk competition, captured a recording contract with Warner Brothers, and on his 1993 recording Wish seemed to be following in his father's footpsteps, covering Ornette on the opening track with a band that featured Coleman alums Charlie Haden and Billy Higgins, as well as guitarist Pat Metheny.Other early releases, such as the exemplary double compact disc release Spur of the Moment, recorded at the Village Vanguard in 1995, and the MoodSwing project from the same period, were more overtly traditional but hardly conventional."}

{"text": "Brazil has long enjoyed the most stable homegrown jazz scene of any South American country.True, it has also lost talent to the United States, starting with guitarist Laurindo Almeida's move to join the Stan Kenton band in 1947 and accelerating during the bossa nova craze of the 1960s.But many of the leading Brazilian jazz figures either returned home or never left."}
{"text": "Widespread poverty makes it an unlikely place for a major jazz act to tour, and the challenges of building a substantial jazz career from an African base are almost insurmountable except for the most driven and determined of individuals.Even back in the 1950s, the 'township jazz' sound of southern Africa, with its strong rhythm-and-blues elements and absence of modern jazz mannerisms-think of it as hard bop without the bop-showed that fresh sounds could arise from this part of the world, although few overseas were paying attention at the time.A handful of African-born talents have managed to come to the attention of jazz audiences since the 1960s."}

{"text": "From its earliest days, jazz had been a forward-looking art, continually incorporating new techniques, more expansive harmonies, more complex rhythms, more intricate melodies.Sometimes this ideology of progress was stated explicitly, as in Beiderbecke and the Chicagoans' oft-spoken praise of Stravinsky and other contemporary classical composers; in other instances, no words were necessary, as with the implicit modernism of Armstrong's breakthrough recordings of the 1920s.But whether they expostulated about the future of music or merely announced its arrival through the bells of their horns, the leading musicians of early jazz were modernists in the truest sense of the term."}
{"text": "One searches in vain through all the countries of the world to find another example of such a rapid and dramatic transformation from folk music to art music.Given this feat, the rise of a more overt modernism in the early 1940s should not be viewed as an abrupt shift, as a major discontinuity in the music's history.It was simply an extension of jazz's inherent tendency to mutate, to change, to grow."}
{"text": "To do the same with Stravinsky and Hindemith, Schoenberg and Ravel presented, no doubt, an extraordinary challenge, but also an inevitable one.By the 1930s, the question now was not whether jazz would embrace modernism, but when and how and by whom.As early as 1931, journalists were comparing Ellington to Stravinsky and Ravel."}
{"text": "True, these devices had been used in jazz before, but never to such a degree.Ellington's keyboard work from the 1930s and 1940s was heavily laced with dissonance, but these avant-garde tendencies were evident only to careful listeners who detected the eccentric piano work that underlay the big band sound.And, of course, the chords of 'Ko Ko' were anything but new, having been borrowed wholesale from the swing standard 'Cherokee.'"}
{"text": "But with the advent of bebop, a whole generation of black musicians was asserting itself as coequals with the purveyors of highbrow culture, the classical composers, the dramatists, the poets, the painters, the sculptors.Another generation would pass before jazz musicians began attending music conservatories in large numbers, but already by the 1940s the ethos that would inspire such ambitions was already evident.If a contradiction existed, it was exemplified most concretely in the music and abbreviated career of Charlie Parker."}
{"text": "Jazz's past and future intersect in the life and times of this seminal figure.Born in Kansas City, Kansas, on August 29, 1920-and moving across the border to Kansas City, Missouri, at age seven-Parker imbibed this tradition at its source, his formative years coinciding with the Pendergast era of semilegal vice with a jazz accompaniment.Like many of his generation, Parker learned jazz through recordings as well as at first hand-but most of his major influences were linked to his Kansas City environs."}
{"text": "The precise dating of this workout over the changes of 'Honeysuckle Rose' and 'Body and Soul' has generated much debate.Some have placed it as early as 1937, others as late as 1940.Moreover, the maturity of Parker's conception also supports a recording date of around 1940, after his return to Kansas City from his Chicago and Harlem experiences."}
{"text": "Some have placed it as early as 1937, others as late as 1940.Moreover, the maturity of Parker's conception also supports a recording date of around 1940, after his return to Kansas City from his Chicago and Harlem experiences.After all, Parker later claimed that his initial breakthrough-a realization that the higher intervals of the chord could serve as the basic springboard for melodic improvisation-took place during this New York visit."}
{"text": "His solos graced a number of McShann recordings from this period, commercial sides as well as amateur transcriptions, and attracted a small cadre of admirers-albeit mostly among other musicians rather than the general public.Especially revealing are performances from November 1940 recorded at a local radio station by several ardent Wichita University jazz fans.But, once again on 'Honeysuckle Rose,' Parker distinguishes himself with a commanding improvisation, daring in its melodic thrusts and executed with fluidity."}
{"text": "This is the saxophonist's strongest recorded work to date, confirmed further by 'Sepian Bounce' and 'Swingmatism' from the same period.Although the influence of Lester Young has been frequently highlighted-and no doubt proved crucial in Parker's musical development-the altoist clearly drew inspiration from a variety of other sources during the late 1930s and early 1940s.At other points, momentary echoes of Willie Smith and Johnny Hodges can be heard in his playing."}
{"text": "Slow dancers seeking a romantic interlude were now advised to keep their distance from the jazz bandstand.In 1940, the Cab Calloway band came to Kansas City, with a young trumpeter named John Gillespie-already dubbed Dizzy by his colleagues-in the horn section.During an intermission, trumpeter Buddy Anderson told Gillespie about a local saxophonist who was well worth hearing."}
{"text": "Years later, both Parker and Gillespie would play similar mind games on other, lesser players.At the early 1940s sessions at Minton's and Monroe's, the Harlem clubs where the bebop vocabulary was refined, the cognoscenti used fast tempos and complex melody lines to intimidate outsiders and establish their own credentials.In a setting where conservatory degrees were still unknown, one's curriculum vitae was earned every night on the bandstand."}
{"text": "One measure of how well he succeeded would come several years later when he joined the Teddy Hill band himself, filling the same role that Eldridge had held before him.In fall 1933, Gillespie entered the Laurinburg Institute in North Carolina, where he pursued the formal study of music.His grasp of harmony was further enriched by his work on the piano, where he tried out chord structures and, in later years, wrote most of his compositions and arrangements."}
{"text": "His grasp of harmony was further enriched by his work on the piano, where he tried out chord structures and, in later years, wrote most of his compositions and arrangements.In spring 1935, his family moved to Philadelphia, and the youngster followed a few months later.Here he began working odd jobs as a professional musician and associating with other aspiring young trumpeters-in particular his cousin Charlie Shavers, three months older than Dizzy, who would come to prominence as a soloist with the John Kirby sextet, one of the finer small combos of its day, and later with the Tommy Dorsey big band."}
{"text": "These elements of showmanship, which connected Dizzy to the prebop tradition of jazz trumpet-not just Eldridge, but back further to Armstrong-also were appreciated by the general public, who accorded Gillespie a fame and following that no other bebopper enjoyed.In 1937, Gillespie, only nineteen years old, moved to New York.Here he stayed with his brother and experienced the wide range of music the city had to offer."}
{"text": "A chance encounter with Teddy Hill at the Savoy Ballroom led to Gillespie joining Hill's band for a European tour.His solos on the band's May 1937 recordings of 'King Porter Stomp' and 'Blue Rhythm Fantasy' make clear that Gillespie was already a skillful imitator of Eldridge's work.The addition of Kenny Clarke to the Teddy Hill band brought Gillespie into close contact with a drummer who would help transform the rhythmic pulse in modern jazz."}
{"text": "His opportunities outside of the Calloway band also began to expand.In 1939, Gillespie was enlisted to participate in the Lionel Hampton recording of 'When Lights Are Low' and 'Hot Mallets,' where he worked alongside a horn section composed of Ben Webster, Coleman Hawkins, Benny Carter, and Chu Berry.Less visible to the public, but even more influential, were the informal sessions Gillespie was attending when the Calloway band resided in New York."}
{"text": "Instead, he delved more deeply into textures and dissonances, and pursued a style of improvisation far more compositional in nature.Few other pianists were prepared to follow in this path until the 1950s, and the full extent of his impact would not be felt until after his death in 1982.Only a few days younger than Gillespie, Monk had been born in Rocky Mountain, North Carolina, on October 10, 1917, but spent most of his youth in the San Juan Hill section of New York."}

{"text": "Despite his prominence as a master of traditional styles, Hines had put together what may well have been the most forward-looking jazz orchestra of its day.From 1928 to 1939, Hines had found a safe haven from the Great Depression, which decimated the careers of so many musicians, as leader of the house band at the Grand Terrace, a posh Chicago nightclub.Hines was almost the antithesis of Ellington, preferring to delegate responsibility for his band's sound rather than take an active role as leader."}
{"text": "But almost at the crest of the Swing Era, Hines was already embracing even more modern sounds.The first signs of the Hines band's flirtation with bebop could be seen in 1941, when members Billy Eckstine, Budd Johnson, Freddie Webster, Little Benny Harris, and Shadow Wilson all showed, to a greater or lesser extent, leanings toward a more progressive conception of jazz.These allegiances exploded into full-fledged modernism late in 1942 when Hines hired Gillespie, whose reputation had spread through his work with Calloway, Lucky Millinder, and others."}

{"text": "Or so one suspects.The 1943 Earl Hines orchestra ranks only slightly below the Buddy Bolden band as the most important unrecorded ensemble in the history of jazz.Nor do later recordings by the band provide much information."}
{"text": "Hines was unable to retain this all-star lineup of emerging stars for long, and by the time he returned to the studio the group had lost its key soloists.Little Benny Harris left in July 1943, and Parker departed in August.Soon after, Billy Eckstine quit to form his own band, eventually bringing with him some of Hines's finest talents, including Gillespie and Vaughan."}
{"text": "Under somewhat different circumstances, Eckstine might have approached the popularity of a Nat King Cole, or even a Frank Sinatra, but the broader audience he sought mostly eluded him.This early 1940s Eckstine band, the most important of his career, did little to help his prospects, dividing critics and making little headway with the general public.Yet its solid musicianship and modern jazz ethos established it as a major forerunner to the bop big bands of Gillespie, Woody Herman, and others."}
{"text": "As the music's audience shifted from dance aficionados to serious listeners, these clubs gained distinction as the new center of the jazz universe, close enough to Times Square to draw visitors, servicemen on leave, and patrons of New York theater and nightlife.Today this urban landscape is dotted with banks and retail stores-the last jazz club shut its doors in 1968-but while the glory days lasted, this stretch of less than a half-kilometer was the epicenter of hot improvised music in America.The arrival of bebop on Fifty-second Street marked a signal event, initiated by Dizzy Gillespie's stint with a small combo at the Onyx Club in early 1944."}

{"text": "Gillespie eventually expanded the band to a quintet with the addition of Don Byas, a Hawkins-inspired tenor saxophonist who stood out as one of the few Swing Era horn players who successfully adapted to the demands of bebop.The inevitable appearance of Charlie Parker on Fifty-second Street in September 1944, for an engagement at the Three Deuces, built on the interest generated by Gillespie's band.Now elevated from the after-hours clubs and jam sessions of its early days, bebop was legitimized by its presentation in quasi-respectable venues; moreover, the reverberations of modern jazz, already fueled by word of mouth, were now being amplified by commercial recordings and radio broadcasts."}
{"text": "Downbeat, which delighted in the controversy, ran a photo commemorating the event.Before 1945, only a few recordings of this new music had been available to the general public, but now several small record companies, such as Guild and Savoy, began to sense opportunities in promoting the modern jazz idiom.On February 9, Gillespie recorded an impressive performance of 'Blue 'n' Boogie' with a band that also included saxophonist Dexter Gordon."}

{"text": "Howard McGhee confided to Russell that he felt Parker was 'cracking up.' 6 Despite these warning signs, Russell scheduled a session for July 29.He persevered even when Bird arrived at the studio in an almost comatose state-and despite the warning of Dr."}
{"text": "His tone was sweeter and smoother than Gillespie's-with greater use of the tongue in articulating notes, in contrast to Dizzy's more slurred attack-but his overall style was still hot and swinging.Discographers tell us that the latter performance was recorded at Birdland only a few days before Navarro died from tuberculosis in 1950 at age twenty-six-an assertion almost impossible to believe given the forcefulness and absolute command of Navarro's playing.Under different circumstances, Navarro's reputation might have matched Clifford Brown's or even Miles Davis's."}
{"text": "Many of his other pieces-'Good Bait,' 'Our Delight,' and 'Lady Bird'-have also become part of the standard jazz repertoire.By temperament, Dameron might have been inclined to focus on composing, but earning a livelihood in the jazz world in the mid-1940s was difficult without toiling nightly as a performer.Hence, Dameron increasingly gravitated toward the club scene."}
{"text": "Later Dameron bands featured Clifford Brown and Miles Davis.By the mid-1950s, Dameron had become inactive, due partly to his reserved personality, but even more to a growing dependence on narcotics, a problem that eventually led to incarceration.Between his release in 1961 and his death in 1965, Dameron attempted to reenter the fray of the jazz world, but never with more than passing success."}

{"text": "Although their collaboration was short-lived-Pozo was killed in a Harlem altercation the following year-it set a precedent rich in implications for both Gillespie and the jazz world as a whole.True, there had been earlier attempts to fuse Latin music with jazz, but none had the symbolic impact of Gillespie's appearance with Pozo on the stage of Carnegie Hall in September 1947.This rhythm shows up in Joplin's 'Solace' and in the second theme of W."}
{"text": "Pozo carried a long knife with him wherever he went, as well as a bullet permanently lodged in his spine, a carryover from a disagreement over royalties.Pozo was shot in a New York barroom in December 1948, only fourteen months after his triumphant Carnegie Hall debut with Dizzy Gillespie.That same Carnegie Hall performance also featured a much-anticipated reunion of Gillespie with Charlie Parker."}
{"text": "Spitting out scorching, jagged phrases, Gillespie played one of the strongest-and almost certainly the fastest-solos of his career.Again at the Clef record date in 1950 and at the Massey Hall concert in 1953, Parker and Gillespie would spur each other to create some of the most memorable performances of the bebop idiom.For his day-to-day working band, Parker had enlisted a trumpeter who would eventually come to represent the opposite stylistic pole to Gillespie's heated pyrotechnics."}
{"text": "With Davis, with Chet Baker, with Kenny Dorham, with Red Rodney-Parker invariably reached for a more low-key and reflective melodic voice, a tonic to offset his acidic alto lines.But then again, this interpretation may be reading too much into Miles Davis, circa 1947.Davis, at that time, was still under Gillespie's spell, struggling to fit his introverted temperament into the latter's extroverted style."}
{"text": "Louis, he exhibited a street-smart toughness that seemed more in tune with life on the wrong side of the tracks.Davis's father was a successful dental surgeon with three degrees, who also owned a two-hundred-acre farm-as late as 1962, when Miles was earning a six-figure income, he could boast that his father was worth more than he was.Yet this scion of a successful family came to be dubbed the 'Prince of Darkness' by some-no carefree nickname, Fats or Sonny, for him-and the title matched the moods of this aloof man who associated with prizefighters, filled his autobiography with expletives, and left behind a litter of strained relationships."}
{"text": "There are no easy answers, or glib one-paragraph summaries, when one deals with Miles Davis.Born in Alton, Illinois, on May 26, 1926, Davis moved with his family to East St. Louis when he was still an infant.Louis when he was still an infant."}
{"text": "Miles's father intervened in favor of his son's choice.In September 1944, Miles arrived in New York, passed his audition at the conservatory, and enrolled as a student.Instead, Miles's 'classrooms' of choice were Minton's, the Savoy Ballroom, the Three Deuces, the Onyx, the Spotlite, and other centers of jazz activity."}
{"text": "His lines suffered by comparison with his models, lacking the balance and clarity of a Navarro or Webster, the electricity of a Gillespie.Yet when Parker went into the studio to record for Savoy in November 1945, he brought Miles along on trumpet-an even more telling decision when one considers that Dizzy was also present that day, but enlisted to play piano.This was an extreme vote of confidence in the nineteen-year-old trumpeter."}
{"text": "' I didn't really think I was ready.'When Parker left for Los Angeles in December 1945, Davis decided to follow him, using a gig with Benny Carter's band as a way of getting to the West Coast.In Los Angeles, Davis played with Bird at the Finale, and again recorded with him for the Dial label."}
{"text": "But Bird, now at the peak of his career, was no longer content to work regularly as sideman-or even coleader-with Gillespie.In April 1947, Parker opened with his new quintet at the Three Deuces on Fifty-second Street.In forming his new group, Bird again selected Davis, along with Max Roach, bassist Tommy Potter, and pianist Duke Jordan."}
{"text": "'Chasin' the Bird' from the same session is equally noteworthy, with Parker abandoning the standard unison lines of his melodies in favor of some clever counterpoint.In the closing months of 1947, Parker returned to the studio once each month with his working band to record again for Russell's Dial label, now relocated back East.The most ambitious piece from these three sessions, 'The Hymn,' attempts to recreate the excitement of 'Ko Ko' with a blistering tempo and a melody built, like 'Cherokee,' mostly on whole and half notes."}
{"text": "They were followed by a series of Johnson collaborations with other leading modern jazz performers-including Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Clifford Brown, and Stan Getz.Despite the accolades of jazz insiders, Johnson's career dipped for a time in the early 1950s and he was forced to take a day job as a blueprint inspector at a Long Island factory.But, in 1955, Johnson finally won the Downbeat poll on his instrument and began enjoying greater success as a leader, often in conjunction with fellow trombonist Kai Winding."}

{"text": "But again, the most powerful performance comes on a slow number, this time the stunning blues 'Parker's Mood,' which marked a surprising return to Parker's Kansas City roots.Renouncing the virtuosity, the arcane chord substitutions, the fast tempos-the very trademarks of the Bird sound-Parker created one of his most gut-wrenching performances, a quasivocal horn lament that, in its starkness, is almost the antithesis of the maximalist leanings of his mid-1940s work.Of course, the more intense side of Parker's music still flourished, but in this later stage of his career it was more evident outside the studio, in the many amateur recordings of his public performances and private jam sessions."}
{"text": "This 'underground' Parker is extensively documented.The Dean Benedetti tapes and discs alone, which came to light in the late 1980s, include more than four hundred previously unknown Parker solos.But this represents only a small part of the bootleg Bird."}
{"text": "After all, Granz was one of the best jazz record producers of the period, a stickler for using the finest musicians, both as leaders and sidemen, and putting them in settings where they could play unadulterated jazz.In fact, Granz had been responsible for the inspired 1946 pairing of Parker and Lester Young that produced a classic recording of 'Oh, Lady Be Good.'But Parker's 1949-54 sessions for Granz rarely approached the level of this one earlier work."}

{"text": "In general, Gillespie's work with Granz was more uniformly successful.This collaboration flourished in the 1950s and was renewed in the 1970s, when Granz formed his Pablo label.Granz tempered Dizzy's tendency to take the easy way out with novelty songs, offbeat vocals, and crowd-pleasing antics, and instead consistently placed him in the midst of other world-class players."}
{"text": "In these settings, Gillespie put aside his affable stage personality and played with fire.By comparison, when Gillespie operated his own record label, Dee Gee, for a time in the early 1950s, the results were uneven.Solid jazz records were interspersed with clumsy offerings such as 'Swing Low, Sweet Cadillac,' 'Umbrella Man,' and 'School Days.'"}
{"text": "With Granz, however, Gillespie needed to show up at the studio ready for battle.In his 1957 recording of' I Know That You Know,' Dizzy must follow a scintillating Sonny Rollins stop-time solo and obliges with a tour de force effort.A 1956 session finds the trumpeter in the middle of a heated saxophone duel between Stan Getz and Sonny Stitt; in song after song, each taken at a furious tempo, Gillespie feeds off the energy of the two combatants."}

{"text": "Matters were further complicated by Parker's problems with his cabaret card, which made it difficult for him to work in New York during a period of almost two years.There was heavy symbolism in the fact that Parker even came to be considered persona non grata at Birdland, the premier jazz club that had been named in the altoist's honor in 1950.His final club appearance was marred by an embarrassing onstage confrontation with pianist Bud Powell, an unfortunate swan song to cap Bird's volatile career."}
{"text": "Friends would tell of Bird arriving unannounced, knocking at doors in the middle of the night, seeking drugs, money, distraction.The inevitable terminal illness came in March 1955.Parker needed to get to Boston for a club engagement but, beset by the pain of his aggravated ulcer, made it no farther than the apartment of his friend, the Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter."}
{"text": "If Adderley failed to become the bebop messiah that fans were seeking, he nonetheless did an admirable job of pleasing both jazz purists and casual audiences, who relished his funk-inflected performances such as 'Dis Here,' 'Work Song,' and 'Mercy, Mercy, Mercy.'Phil Woods, another much-lauded 'disciple of Bird,' also made a splash on the New York jazz scene in the mid-1950s, both through his work as a leader and in his extensive sideman efforts.For a time Woods was perhaps too much in demand as a session player."}
{"text": "His gigs as a bandleader became less frequent, and his promise as a major jazz star seemed destined to be only partly realized.Between 1958 and 1967, Woods made only four recordings as a leader.But with the formation of his excellent European ensemble in 1968, and his return to bebop roots with his post-1974 American bands, Woods made it clear that he belongs on any short list of leading post-Parker alto saxophonists."}

{"text": "His early work with Miles Davis and as a leader revealed an allegiance to the bop style, but McLean remained open to the influence of other approaches, with elements of John Coltrane's modal excursions, Sonny Rollins's hard bop, and Ornette Coleman's free playing eventually entering into his music.By the time of his vital recordings from the 1960s for the Blue Note label, McLean was brandishing an urgent sax style, one that had largely discarded the formulaic resolutions of bop.These three players-Adderley, Woods, McLean-in turn came to be revered as influential stylists in their own right, with a host of younger players following in their footsteps."}

{"text": "Yet the two retained a strong mutual admiration and willingness to assist each other, rare among jazz contemporaries who play the same instrument.In 1944, Powell recorded with Williams, both in big band and combo settings.Here his modern jazz leanings, while already apparent, were tempered by Swing Era conventions."}
{"text": "The miracle is that Powell managed so well for so long in the face of this dual existence as part-time patient, full-time jazz legend.His recordings from the late 1940s-made after his ordeal with electroshock therapy at Creedmoor-include some of the most compelling piano trio music in the history of jazz.His work on fast numbers is especially noteworthy."}
{"text": "His work on fast numbers is especially noteworthy.A session with Max Roach and Ray Brown from February 1949 produced three high-speed masterpieces.On 'Tempus Fugit,' Powell exudes an almost diabolical level of energy, while on two standards, 'Cherokee' and 'All God's Chillun Got Rhythm,' Powell anchors his attack with intricate passing chords working in contrary motion to the melody."}
{"text": "But this was also a general weakness of his whole generation of jazz pianists.Not until the late 1950s did modern jazz piano refine an original and authentic approach to ballad playing.Powell had a glimpse of this future, as his impressionistic piece 'Parisian Thoroughfare' makes clear."}
{"text": "Jazz piano would eventually break through this stylistic dead end by paring away ruthlessly at the unnecessary notes and AD lib fills-a process propelled by the contributions of Bill Evans and Ahmad Jamal-but this radical pruning, built on a reassessment of the importance of space and silence, was still some years away at the time of Powell's best work.Along with most other pianists who came of age between 1940 and 1950, Powell was at his sharpest when the tempo approached or exceeded two hundred beats per minute.Almost all of Powell's most important recordings were completed by the time of his thirtieth birthday."}
{"text": "Almost all of Powell's most important recordings were completed by the time of his thirtieth birthday.In fact, Powell's reputation as the leading keyboard voice of the bebop movement would be well established if only on the basis of his extraordinary output from the two-year period stretching from May 1949 to May 1951.The quality of Powell's later work has been the subject of much debate, but even its most ardent supporters stop short of comparing it to these early efforts."}
{"text": "Clearly the later Powell was capable of occasional stellar performances.The best of these were often in the company of other premier jazz players-with Parker and Gillespie at Massey Hall in 1953; with Coleman Hawkins in 1960; with Dexter Gordon in 1963-or on occasional trio settings where he showed glimpses of greatness, as in his Lausanne recording from 1962.But these were, at best, compelling enough to remind listeners of Powell's early prowess, and never so good as to make them forget it."}
{"text": "Even small doses of alcohol could have a devastating effect, and friends learned to keep him away from the bottle at all costs.The death of his brother Richie in a 1956 auto accident, as well as the passing of Parker and many other of his contemporaries, may also have weighed heavily on Powell.In his early thirties, a period that finds most jazz players in peak playing form, Powell struggled with health problems and hospital stays."}

{"text": "He performed little after this, and his health continued to deteriorate.On July 31, 1966, less than two years after his New York homecoming, Powell died, ostensibly due to the combined effects of tuberculosis, alcoholism, and malnutrition.He was forty-one years old."}
{"text": "This so-called 'Detroit style' actually spanned a wide range of sounds, stretching from the refined keyboard mannerisms of Hank Jones and Tommy Flanagan to the harder-driving piano work of Barry Harris, but all of them could trace their lineage back to Powell.By the mid-1950s, other jazz keyboard approaches had emerged, but even the pianists whose work stood out as the most original-Bill Evans, Horace Silver, Ahmad Jamal, Oscar Peterson, Cecil Taylor- still owed an enormous debt to this pioneer of modern jazz.The career of Powell's mentor and friend Thelonious Monk presents virtually a mirror image of this tale of dissipating creativity and declining fame."}

{"text": "But Feather was not alone.At the close of the 1940s, Monk's music was perceived by most members of the jazz community as too far outside the mainstream to be valued in its own right, and too personal to influence other players.His style, built on disjunction, stood as a puzzling connect-the-dots drawing for which most listeners could not see the overall picture."}
{"text": "And though he occasionally tackled the standard songs of the bebop repertoire, Monk preferred to play his own pieces-and played them again and again, often recording the same tune a half-dozen or more times over the course of his career.Even before Monk's comeback in the 1950s, the pianist gave notice of his singular vision of jazz, although few outside the inner circles of modern jazz were paying attention at the time.The amateur recordings made by Columbia student Jerry Newman at Minton's testify to the pianist's iconoclasm-one would be hard pressed to find a more forward-looking jazz piano performance, circa 1941, than Monk's reconfiguration of George Gerswhin's 'Nice Work if You Can Get It.'"}

{"text": "The two remaining Blue Note sessions from this period resulted in milestone performances of a number of other important Monk compositions, including Round Midnight,' 'Epistrophy,' ' I Mean You,' 'Misterioso,' 'In Walked Bud,' and 'Monk's Mood.'In particular, the July 2, 1948, session, in which Monk plays cat and mouse with vibraphonist Milt Jackson, stood out as the most complete statement to date of his unorthodox musical values.Yet three years would elapse before Monk returned to the studio as a leader."}
{"text": "Yet three years would elapse before Monk returned to the studio as a leader.In a prescient 1948 interview, Orrin Keepnews-who would later become Monk's record producer-cited the pianist as potentially representing' a huge step forward' in modern jazz and noted that his music was further away from the bop idiom than most commentators had realized.And those fans who hoped to make up their own mind about the so-called 'high priest of bop' had little chance to do so."}
{"text": "Monk played infrequent engagements, with most of his music making taking place at home.Monk's return to the studio in July 1951 represented progress of sorts.But opportunities to record came at the same time that Monk's cabaret card was revoked due to a narcotics arrest."}
{"text": "That event led to a six-year involuntary absence from New York nightclubs.Meanwhile, Monk's recordings during this period document a major burst of creativity and set the foundation for his ascendancy to the top of the jazz world in the late 1950s and early 1960s.In his comeback session for Blue Note, Monk featured some of his most complex compositions."}
{"text": "This initiated a six-year relationship during which Monk, under Keepnews's supervision, undertook twenty-eight recording sessions.These were fertile years for Monk, not so much because his music evolved during this period-on the contrary, his style changed very little after the mid-1940s-but because he was finally provided with the chance to express his musical ideas in a wide range of conducive contexts.Monk had always excelled in a trio setting, and his first several Riverside sessions followed that format."}
{"text": "Despite his lengthy absence from the New York nightclub circuit, Monk's reputation was soaring and his records selling in increasing quantities.Infrequent public appearances may have only added to his mystique-a program for a 1955 concert described him, tellingly, as the 'Greta Garbo of jazz.'The reinstatement of his cabaret card put an end to his apparent reclusiveness but did nothing to hinder his popularity."}
{"text": "The reinstatement of his cabaret card put an end to his apparent reclusiveness but did nothing to hinder his popularity.His booking at the Five Spot during the summer of 1957 showed the breadth and depth of his newfound audience.Drawing full houses night after night, his engagement was extended to eight months, and management brought in a special piano chosen by Monk himself."}
{"text": "During their few months together, these two premier stylists-one espousing a music of pregnant pauses and lingering overtones, the other filling each measure to the fullest, to overflowing, in a music of delirious excess-called to mind the physicists' assertion that the creative energy of the universe is founded, ultimately, on the attraction of opposites.On the crest of the sensation caused by the Five Spot band, Monk was enjoying unprecedented attention and praise, first among jazz insiders, who awarded him first place in the Downbeat Critics Poll in both 1958 and 1959, and gradually from the general public.He now toured frequently, both throughout the United States and overseas, and by 1960 was able to demand $1,000 for a one-night stand, substantially more than what he had charged for a full-week booking only two years earlier."}

{"text": "His odd mannerisms and onstage demeanor may have amused audiences, but the deeper-seated psychological problems they represented were no laughing matter.In 1958, Monk's obsessive pacing in a Delaware hotel lobby, and his steadfast refusal to respond to questions, led to a heated confrontation with local police.The following year, Monk ended a strange performance at Boston's Storyville Club by remaining seated on the piano bench, motionless and impassive, long after his sidemen had left the stage."}
{"text": "Later that same night, Monk was arrested at the airport and brought by a state trooper to Grafton State Hospital, where he was placed under observation for a week.During the 1960s, Monk received medical treatment for depression, and his personality grew ever more remote.Sometimes he would remain aloof for days at a time, with even his wife, Nellie, unable to extract more than a word or two from him."}
{"text": "Indeed, the pianist's fame and following were now great enough to attract the interest of a major label.In 1962, Monk signed with Columbia, and under the aegis of this entertainment industry powerhouse, his reputation continued to grow, even if his music changed little, culminating in a February 28, 1964, Time magazine cover story.By the mid-1960s, Monk was as much a legend as a musician."}

{"text": "Still, the best of these works served as important additions to Monk's oeuvre.Despite the travails of his personal life, Monk maintained a fairly hectic recording and performance schedule during his first several years with Columbia, but by the close of the 1960s his activities had tapered off.In the 1970s, Monk's public appearances, like his Delphic utterances, grew even less frequent."}

{"text": "As befitted a legend, he remained mostly out of sight.His last official performance came at a Carnegie Hall concert in 1976, but, in an appropriate coda to his career, Monk surprised listeners one night after that by sitting in at Bradley's, a small New York bar where few would have expected this reclusive jazz master to grace the keys.In his final years, the pianist resided with the Baroness de Koenigswarter, who had also befriended Charlie Parker during the altoist's last illness."}

{"text": "He was sixty-four years old.As early as the mid-1950s, a few jazz pianists were paying close attention to Monk's example.For players such as Herbie Nichols, Richard Twardzik, Randy Weston, Mal Waldron, and Elmo Hope, several elements of Monk's playing proved especially influential."}
{"text": "But Monk's music was equally admired for its primal insistence, for his vision of the piano as a percussion instrument-a sensibility that shaped the pianist's tone control, phrasing, and sense of rhythm.Following Monk's model, however, was fraught with difficulties in the mid-1950s.Nichols, Twardzik, and Hope have each received far more recognition posthumously than during their abbreviated careers."}
{"text": "However, these are substantial works by any measure and indicate that had he lived longer-Twardzik was dead of a drug overdose before his twenty-fifth birthday-he might have established himself as one of the leading jazz players of his generation.Hope's visionary style came to the fore on recordings made, as both a leader and sideman, in New York during the mid-1950s, but the revocation of his cabaret card due to drug problems limited his ability to build on these accomplishments.After relocating to California, Hope undertook sessions under his own name, as well as contributed greatly to the success of Harold Land's classic recording The Fox."}
{"text": "Like Monk, Hope found his music branded as 'difficult,' and few listeners were willing to make the effort to probe its rich implications.He continued to work and record sporadically after his return to New York in early 1961 until his death six years later, but never gained a following commensurate with the virtues of his steely and multifaceted music.Lennie Tristano's impact on the development of jazz piano is perhaps even more difficult to gauge than Monk's."}
{"text": "In the last twenty years of his life, his performances were increasingly rare, new recordings all but nonexistent, and older ones mostly out of print.By the time of his death in 1978, Tristano was a largely forgotten figure, relegated to the fringes of the jazz world.Yet there was some irony to this turn of events."}
{"text": "For the evolution of jazz piano was increasingly turning in precisely the direction that Tristano had foretold.Moreover, a number of Tristano's most daring initiatives from the late 1940s and early 1950s-involving atonality, total improvisation, overdubbing, and other unusual devices-could now be seen as foreshadowing key developments in the later history of jazz.A flu epidemic left Tristano blind shortly after his birth in Chicago on March 19, 1919."}

{"text": "After completing his bachelor's degree at the American Conservatory of Music, Tristano began taking students in addition to performing in and around the Chicago area.By 1945, Tristano had attracted a small coterie of promising pupils, including saxophonist Lee Konitz, guitarist Billy Bauer, and composer/trombonist Bill Russo.Tristano's first recordings, made around this time, reveal that his style was already fully formed, and that his conception of the keyboard was frighteningly advanced."}

{"text": "In truth, placing Tristano within the context of a specific period and jazz movement has proven all too difficult.Most commentators and historians have listed him as a member of the cool school that predominated during the 1950s.But this classification captures only a small part of Tristano's legacy."}
{"text": "However, to my ears, Tristano's closest allegiance was to none of these schools, but rather to the bebop movement; he shared its fascination with long melodic lines, its celebration of intensity, its refusal to compromise, and its imperative to experiment.Tristano's activities shortly after his move to New York in 1946 support this contention.His stellar trio sides for the Keynote label find him alternating between a block chord style built on dense harmonic structures and a more driving linear approach in a bop vein."}
{"text": "Many other pianists of the period-notably Milt Buckner and George Shearing-would be celebrated for their 'locked hands' chordal style, but none would take it to the daring extremes that Tristano surveyed.It would be hard to find jazz piano recordings from the mid-1940s more drenched in dissonance, more harmonically 'out there' than 'Atonement' and' I Can't Get Started,' from Tristano's 1946-47 Keynote performances.His way of using elongated phrases was equally pathbreaking."}
{"text": "Konitz participated in the influential Miles Davis Birth of the Cool sessions, and for many years affected a sweet tone and lyricism that one never heard in Tristano.The relationship between teacher and pupil was often strained, and after the early 1950s the two players mostly went their separate ways, with Konitz serving for a time with the Stan Kenton band and subsequently leading his own combos.Tenor saxophonist Warne Marsh had already worked as a professional musician for several years before connecting with Tristano around 1947."}

{"text": "Konitz and Marsh both rank among the most consistently creative improvisers of their generation-and were especially potent when in each other's company.Examples of this musical chemistry can be found not just on the sessions with Tristano but also in other settings, for example, their artful 1955 collaboration for the Atlantic label and their stunning 1959 sessions with Bill Evans at the Half Note.Tristano's 1949 recordings with Konitz and Marsh include some of the most intriguing jazz performances of the period."}

{"text": "As a result, this music risks giving listeners a queasy, ungrounded sensation, despite its lissome execution.Tristano's 1949 recordings for Capitol also approach musical vertigo at times, but the playing is more robust, especially in the aptly titled 'Wow.''Intuition' and 'Digression' from this period are the first recorded examples in the jazz idiom of completely free-form group improvisation."}
{"text": "'Intuition' and 'Digression' from this period are the first recorded examples in the jazz idiom of completely free-form group improvisation.Four years later, Tristano would again anticipate the later evolution of free jazz with his jarringly atonal work 'Descent into the Maelstrom'-although this savage assault on the keyboard could exert no direct influence on the late 1950s avant-garde since it remained unreleased for over two decades.Even when he pursued more mainstream efforts, Tristano seemed doomed to get caught up in controversy and partisan jazz debates."}
{"text": "Even when he pursued more mainstream efforts, Tristano seemed doomed to get caught up in controversy and partisan jazz debates.His 1955 recordings of 'Line Up' and 'Turkish Mambo' for the Atlantic label employed overdubbing and tape manipulation.Critics complained that Tristano 'sped up' the tape of 'Line Up,' and the resulting brouhaha prevented many from hearing the riveting brilliance of the improvisation."}
{"text": "Much of his best work was captured on amateur recordings that, like 'Descent into the Maelstrom,' were not issued for many years.Several of Tristano's outstanding performances with Lee Konitz made in 1955 at the Sing-Song Room of the Confucius Restaurant were issued by Atlantic in 1956, but many other equally compelling tracks from this engagement were kept off the market until the 1970s.Other live sessions-from the Half Note, Birdland, the UJPO Hall in Toronto, or Tristano's 1965 visit to Europe-are seldom heard, but deserve consideration as vital parts of Tristano's legacy."}

{"text": "However, few jazz artists of his day embraced the tenets of modernism with greater fervor, or anticipated the later evolution of the music with greater insight.These three stylists-Bud Powell, Thelonious Monk, Lennie Tristano-may have redefined the role of the piano in modern jazz, but their music was distinctly unsuitable for the mass market of the 1950s.The listeners who still enjoyed Count Basie or Duke Ellington found little sustenance in the dissonant harmonies of a Monk, the unrelenting energy of a Powell, the serpentine melody lines of a Tristano."}
{"text": "Peterson stood out as one of the hardest swinging pianists of his generation, and though his rhythmic phrasing may have lacked the subtlety of a Parker or Tristano, it possessed a visceral appeal that only the stodgiest critics could deny.Peterson had established a modest reputation in his native Montreal before being discovered by Norman Granz in 1949.That same year, Granz featured Peterson at a much-publicized Carnegie Hall concert, and the impresario continued to play an important role in guiding Peterson's career in later years."}
{"text": "Peterson also occasionally attempted extended works, the best-known of which is his Canadiana Suite.Peterson maintained his popularity through the various revolutions and passing fashions of the jazz scene, and though a 1993 stroke compromised the agility of his left hand, he returned to the keyboard after a two-year hiatus and continued performing until shortly before his death in 2007.Despite the frequent comparisons with Tatum, Peterson's piano style suggests an even greater debt to Nat King Cole."}
{"text": "Despite the frequent comparisons with Tatum, Peterson's piano style suggests an even greater debt to Nat King Cole.Cole's appealing work as a vocalist eventually came to overshadow his prowess as a jazz pianist, but during the 1940s and 1950s, his keyboard approach was widely admired and emulated on the jazz scene.Like Peterson, Cole embraced a style that represented a middle ground between swing and bop."}
{"text": "His incomparable singing, promoted almost to the exclusion of his piano work in later years, veered increasingly outside the jazz realm, but still revealed an exemplary sense of phrasing and clarity of expression with roots in Cole's keyboard approach.London-born George Shearing emigrated to the United States in 1947, at the height of the bebop movement.At his best, Shearing rates praise as an inventive, technically adept pianist with a keen ear and sure sense of swing."}
{"text": "As it stands, much of his recorded output only hints at the depth of his musicality.Shearing's contemporary Erroll Garner also developed a wide following during the 1950s, reaching such heights of fame that in 1958 impresario Sol Hurok, a major force in concert music, made an unprecedented move into the jazz field to represent him.In fact, it is difficult to pigeonhole Garner as a member of any school."}
{"text": "Other Garner projects of note include his Paris Impressions, Afternoon of an Elf, and Magician.Despite the large audience he attracted during his lifetime, Garner has exerted little influence on players who came of age after his death in 1977-yet this is their loss, since his recorded legacy is rich with implication, unhindered by the prosaic, and could serve as the basis for a sparkling and brazen style even today.Ahmad Jamal's sparse, ultracool pianism stands as the antithesis of Garner's rocking rococo ruminations at the keyboard."}
{"text": "Such comments reveal more about the state of jazz criticism during these years-deeply suspicious as it was of any musician who developed a wide following among the general public-than about Jamal's streamlined keyboard attack.In this instance, Jamal's cardinal sin was apparently the substantial success of his 1958 live recording at Chicago's Pershing Lounge, But Not for Me, which reached number three on the Billboard album chart, and remained on the list for over two years.The song 'Poinciana,' recorded at this engagement, would become Jamal's signature theme, and effectively conveys the trademark virtues of his sparse, vibrant keyboard attack."}
{"text": "Drummer Vernel Fournier and bassist Israel Crosby were unsurpassed at swinging while retaining the most subdued dynamic level.Together with Jamal they formed one of the most underappreciated rhythm sections of the 1950s.Jamal's later work found him in a variety of settings, sometimes experimenting with electronics or performing with string accompaniment."}
{"text": "Rather, the building blocks of his success had been slowly put in place during the course of the prior decade.In the late 1940s, Brubeck started drawing attention for his advocacy of the new and unusual, initially through the work of his Octet.This ensemble, which drew on the most progressive strains in both jazz and classical music, was formed during Brubeck's stint at Mills College, where he and many of his colleagues in the Octet were studying with modernist composer Darius Milhaud."}
{"text": "The combo recorded a number of outstanding live performances for the Fantasy label, in which the dictates of modernism and melodicism were artfully balanced.In 1954, Brubeck left Fantasy for the Columbia label and, that same year, his photo graced the cover of Time magazine.The fame and enormous record sales that Brubeck enjoyed were all the more remarkable given the uncompromising nature of his piano work."}
{"text": "Working with an instrumentation and vocabulary formed during the period of jazz's greatest popularity, these large ensembles appeared to be distinctly unsuited to lead the jazz idiom into the modern era.By the start of the 1950s, singers-many of them former vocalists with big bands- had taken center stage in the world of popular music.Instead of Ellington, Goodman, Shaw, Basie, and Miller, the pop charts were dominated by Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Nat King Cole, Jo Stafford, Doris Day, and Perry Como."}
{"text": "Even jazz devotees wavered in their loyalty, increasingly showing a preference for smaller combos.An entertainment tax instituted in 1944, which levied a 30 percent surcharge on venues that allowed dancing, led to a decline in ballroom patronage.This created a wedge between jazz music and dance, which widened during the postwar years due, in part, to a shift in performance styles, with medium tempo swing numbers gradually losing favor to a less danceable mix emphasizing very fast or very slow pieces."}
{"text": "The result was an inexorable decline in the role of dance halls and other big band venues.The contemporary jazz scene of the 1950s was abandoned to the outsiders, the bohemians and beatniks, and the young-those who still frequented the urban clubs late at night.For this crowd, the big band was most often viewed as a dinosaur, the retrograde sound of a generation whose time had already passed."}
{"text": "Unlike the dinosaurs, the big bands avoided total extinction-but just barely.Reading press clippings about swing bands from the late 1940s and early 1950s is as uplifting as browsing through a stack of obituaries.There are mostly tombstones and eulogies, few cigars and celebrations."}
{"text": "There are mostly tombstones and eulogies, few cigars and celebrations.In December 1946 alone, eight major big bands broke up.A host of name leaders, many still in the prime of their lives, took early retirement, changed careers, or retrenched."}
