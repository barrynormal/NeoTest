== A slice of Jazz history 

=== Graphing the musical history behind Miles Davis' 1957 album, _Birth of the Cool_

In 1957 Capitol Records released _Birth of the Cool_ and after that, things just weren't the same.

But how did this masterpiece come about? Did it just come 'out of the blue'? Of course not, there was a whole history of artists interacting, building styles, developing relationships and ways of playing which gradually built towards this recording. 

==== Graphing history
Miles Davis and the shifting group of artists who made up his band, 'nonet', recorded the album during a series of sessions between 1949 and 1950. The tracks were composed and arranged by a number of greats, including https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Mulligan[Gerry Mulligan] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_Evans[Gill Evans].

Each of these artists had a plethora of creative influences, and togehter they had a decisive influence on Jazz, in particular Bebop and Cool Jazz. With all this in mind, let's take a look at the data modeling. 

==== Data modelling Jazz 
This model captures the nouns of the story as nodes for the graph. The actions are represented as relations. Some additional facts and figures, such as dates and names are recorded as properties of the nodes and occasionally, the relations.
